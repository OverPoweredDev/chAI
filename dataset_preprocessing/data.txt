There is a Common Lisp package, [Cells](http://common-lisp.net/project/cells/), which tries to take one of the key features of spreadsheet programming (automatic value propagation) and add it to an object system (CLOS, in this case).

You're confusing the appearance of impropriety with actual wrongdoing. A conflict of interest like this is a good reason to *investigate*, but it's definitely not evidence of wrongdoing.	A conflict of interest is only a problem if it's not disclosed.

Me too.  Anytime I see a decimal point, I immediately start thinking 'rounding error', even when using non-float types.	They all break down somewhere. Decimal can't represent 1/3 losslessly, but fractions can't represent sqr(2) losslessly. The advantage of decimal representation is that you can ensure an arbitrary degree of precision by requiring a certain number of sig figs and doing all adding starting with the smallest pair of numbers.

'Is it necessary to capitalize 'vegan'?' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Only if he's from Vega. ;)	Well, it's obvious that the 'Vegan' is substituting the 'o's with other vowels to confuse us before they blow up our planet. So long and thanks for all the milk and honey.
I'm an English major turned programmer. Whenever people are surprised that I've made 'such a 180' (as someone put it), I always tell them that both fields are all about the power of the written word.	Do you regret you haven't majored in CS?
Bastard.  I was drinking some tea, and... well, long story short, you owe me a new keyboard.	My rule is to drink only while looking away from the screen.  It's especially important if you have a laptop.
I agree, calling someone 'liberal' here (Netherlands) would generally be understood as saying they are right wing. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In the US it is the new 'commie'.	Joseph Schumpeter on the usurpation of 'liberal' by American leftists: 'As a supreme, if unintended, compliment, the enemies of private enterprise have thought it wise to appropriate its label.'
I have it set so that typing jj is equivalent to ESC. It's a real wrist- and time-saver. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Just add 'imap jj &lt;Esc&gt;' to your .vimrc.	I like shift space as escape.
best of luck to you America!	Thank you. We need it.
Agreed. I don't see many people getting upset with statements like 'you have beautiful eyes.'	You have beautiful eyes.
Unfortunately the United States is torturing people that aren't terrorists. Or at least they weren't until they got tortured.	Also, it should not be okay to torture anybody! Ever!
And an interesting conversation between Paul and Guido [continues here](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2007-February/007794.html), where Guido responds to some of Paul's criticisms of the code.	Paul seems like a smart guy. But, damn, someone needs to teach him how to write concisely.
You know what's good? Reading comprehension.	and this applies to me how?
Enjoy your virginity all you programming people!	Enjoy your high horse all you silly people!
I think maybe they changed it so the 'new' page defaults to rising, instead of all. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Try clicking 'all' on the right hand side.  See how you go.	It's always been rising, but rising is weird this morning after we had a slipup last night (I think... still looking into it).

'The U.S. used to be a beacon of freedom and democracy' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar When was that?	you never saw Rambo?
The photo of the raising of the flag was actually *not* staged. Were you merely referring to the controversy surrounding the image, or has recent research flipped sides and begun claiming the photo was staged?	I mean that it was actually the second flag raising of the day, the photographers were given a heads-up after the first, and they told the Marines where to plant the flag for the best photo op.
Somebody, please, post a rebuttal that Clinton fired a bunch of attorneys in 1993 so I have a discrete focus for my anger and frustration.	In fact, Clinton fired *these* attorneys too.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar With mind bullets.

As we all know, China has amassed a considerable amount of human right violations, but U.S. of all countries, is sure as hell not in a position to be finger-pointing.	There is a differential here.  China is significantly worse off on matters like these than we are.  HOWEVER, we *should* read the report and rectify all problems in it.  But it's not like it's telling us anything we don't already know.
Totally agree. Let's talk about Paul Graham getting a cup of coffee.	I think he actually prefers tea.  And he's got an unusual way of brewing it.  Maybe that could be the topic of his next essay.
Even better: click the 'hide' link for every impeachment article. No more Bush impeachment articles on reddit!	yeah, but then i wouldn't get to bitch about people bitching. erm... oh.
I like a Microsoft dig as much as the next guy, but in context it didn't really fit - came across as more of a 'can't really think of a good target here so I'll go for the easy option' option	Yeah, Microsoft don't have stores so they don't have salesmen. It would be better aimed at BestBuy or someone.
Movin' to the country, gonna eat a lot of peaches...	I love peaches. It's the damn ninjas I hate.
betcha those critics didn't think of joining the military themselves. how can having a conscience be unpatriotic and insulting to veterans?	Chickenhawks are the bravest people around.  Nobody dares to challenge a chickenhawk!
Aww, come on, punkgeek. Don't be a tease. Tell us who your footballer friend is. :)	I know who it is.  I'm not sure why punkgeek's not tellin though.  I'll badger him for you.
I think it's because it's a lowest-common-denominator comedy, unlike many of the other BritComs out there, and has been on PBS since forever. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It's also that, to us Americans, a British accent can make the most banal comedy seem funny.	&gt; It's also that, to us Americans, a British accent can make the most banal comedy seem funny. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar A British accent, and vulgar puns about Mrs. Slocombe's... cat.

If they gave us this feed in real-time we could create a hunt for Bin Laden game. Millions of people could play!	he's hiding on the nude beaches!
I don't think anybody has a right to end anyone's life. I'm genuinely curious as to why you do think it's okay to do so?	Because animals aren't people?
In one of his comments it said 5 minutes. That doesn't surprise me at all. He is clearly a master at what he does, and he probably needs but a few glances (after the initial study) to draw the subject.	&gt;[About 20 or 25 minutes usually.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cully/sets/1076165/comments/)

Abraham Lincoln did look oddly Arabian, didn't he?	Jesus looked oddly arabian as well? hrm
Scary- seems like satire, but apparently it's not.	Agreed.  These times have made satire superfluous.
&gt; I hate the fact that Ruby has stolen all its ideas from Smalltalk. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That's not true, it stole stuff from Lisp and Perl as well.	'Good artists borrow; great artists steal'  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My biggest gripe about Ruby is that I don't know it and don't know what all the fuss is about.
It was for a blowjob.  Why are all republicans interested in everyone else's sex life?	Easy, they're sticking up for your right to privacy.
Explanation: http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2007-03-07-n12.html	This really doesn't explain anything.
They're right, but neither does China have that right.  I'd like to hear their justifications for torture.  They'll probably sound a lot like Gonzales's justifications.	It's better this way than to cover each other up.
I was hoping it would be Erlang hosting.	[It's been done.](http://www.vendetta-online.com/h/news.html) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Their backend used to be Lisp, but they have since switched to something they are calling 'Kourier' which is apparently based on Erlang.
Yea, AMD has definitely improved over the years. To the point that many people consider their chips superior to Intel's.	Untill the summer of 2006, that is.
I like it because I'm anal, and I like that the validator will catch me when I fail to close a tag or do something else that would annoy the hell out of me if I realized it later.	+1. Using 'simple' XHTML is like using the highest warning-level on your compiler, it will catch the small mistakes that you forgot and could have resulted in a bug on some browsers.
Did you listen to the podcast for that episode? That was a real, museum-quality model ship! Apparently, Olmos was swept up in the moment of his character and just trashed the thing without telling anyone ahead of time.	Okay, so at least very least the props department was crying.
If I recall correctly, they have a relatively new fab facility in Germany... That's my best guess anyway	They have a very modern and recently upgraded factory in Dresden, yes.
A needless distinction.	The difference between 1 yottabyte and 1 yobibyte is 199,247,188,200,596,976 bytes (177 zebibytes).  I'd say that's significant.
I think the confessional is a attempt at getting part of PostSecret's page views (and eventually putting ads up).  Between moderators and user feedback, I bet spam will be held to a minimum.	I think it's a great idea, but PostSecret has the edge because it includes visuals. It's amazing how a stock photo can make words stand out.
64-bit is a 2^32-fold improvement on 32-bit.  Given Moore's Law, that means we should be good for another 32-64 years.  So, who's started working on 128-bit?  That'll keep us until at least 2103.	Under the assumption that the current growth doesn't turn into an S-curve by then.
I believe most Haskell people hang out at the #haskell IRC channel instead.	and the haskell-cafe mailing list
Well, I think that looks more like a distro-list and not a vendor list. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Do you by any chance have the top ten vendor lists from three years ago and today?	Do the vendors really matter? The OS is commodity, the hardware is commodity.
Evolution is not unpopular. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Atheism is. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Presenting the theory of evolution (a good theory) as fact is.

Um...you guys know that sulphur and brimstone are the same thing, right? :)	Yes everyone knows that sulfur smell and sulfur are the same thing.  How was that pizza you smelled last night?

Fucking hippies are only dangerous if they don't use condoms.	I see what you did there
i don't think it's for the worse. it's not possible.	People always go just beyond what we think is possible.  This will give them the opportunity to appear to be fixing it but slipping in more privacy rape.
Boring as hell. Special effects don't make a movie (some of the effects were cool, but 30 minutes of them would have been more than sufficient). I've only walked out of two movies, but this was nearly one of them.	Somebody needs to tell that to Tim Burton
The 2nd amendment isn't about about defending yourself from junkies, it's about defending your nation from tyrants. newlinechar  newlinechar 	Its about, and Jefferson said this, because the citizens need to protect themselves against standing armies.

A GTI engine on a tractor that's smaller, about 1/3 the weight, and whose single seat not only doesn't have seatbelts, it doesn't even have a seat back... what could possibly go wrong?	Add in the high center of gravity and a steering mechanism that amplifies not reduces steering inputs and you have a spectacularly bad design decision.

If you consider unix to be an operating system whose interface is the C runtime, then yes, that is essentially it. And they're developing movitz under a full common lisp, much in the way linus cross-compiled his kernel from minix.	Why are they doing this again?  What useful characteristics does the Common Lisp spec provide as a runtime?
I know folks at companies of various sizes in the SF area, and none of them has been able to successfully outsource squat.  I'm not saying nobody can do it, but the average US programmer is still way ahead of the average Indian programmer.	The most terrifying thing to me as a future programmer is not that outsourcing works now (it doesn't) but the thought that eventually the rest of the world will be competitive as a replacement for what I do.
Slow down. Nobody's trying to defend Carlos Mencia here. I'm just tired of the constant bitching and moaning over his success. It seems to me that a lot of people do find the guy funny, though.	Dude, a lot of people found *Carrot Top* funny.  How else did he get on TV?
Sometimes I'm horrified by just how little we know about education.	We as psychologists know a lot. But the education train has a lot of momentum going in a different direction.

WiMax is even more scarce than WiFi ;)	Oh, yes. But in some (scarcely populated) places it's more available. Well, wifi/wlan etc aren't usually available at all in remote places :) newlinechar  newlinechar

Truth is truth, and we're all for it, unless you think the way our opponents do.	Yeh, any time I've even questioned global warming here on reddit I got shouted down.

I knew most of those things already.	Thank you the all knowing patron of Wikipedia for sharing your wisdom. The list is actually quite informative as opposed to your post.
That explains why those crackpots in the article say man-made global warming is a conspiracy by politics and scientists. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks for clearing it up.	That's exactly one of the points I made above: there is no unbiased rhetoric on this issue.  Both sides have made up their mind first and looked for evidence second. newlinechar  newlinechar 
And the question I put to you is - is that acceptable? Is a paper about an unreproducible system good science? Should CS aim at being a real science?	You don't understand how science works! The experiment should be reproducible from the algorithms/equations/whatever in the paper, the researcher's code is irrelevant. newlinechar  newlinechar 
Yeah, its sad. But I'll vote for them anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Statistically, my vote counts for nothing anyway so I might as well vote for what I actually believe in.

I think, for the purposes of this discussion, 'beliefs' can be assumed to mean the unfalsifiable kind, such as 'God exists' / 'God does not exist.'  To the extent that that's the case, truth doesn't enter into it...any is as good as the next.	'God exists' is a falsifiable claim.

&gt; Neither trade is known for its intellectualism. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Perhaps not a salesman, but farmers were the original technologists, observing physics and biology, and inventing ways to get and keep bountiful crops and improve their work-efficiency.	I didn't mean to imply that either trades were dumb.  But both are noted for a type of pragmatism that leaves little time for idly wondering about the great mysteries of the physical world.

The question this raises though, is if this was news in 2004, why hasn't anything happened regarding this story since then?	Perhaps it was found to be inaccurate?
Why are people incapable of understanding that criticism of something does not mean you want to legally ban it? Oh, I know, because a lot of people (often religious) cannot conceive of disapproving of something without also twisting the laws of the country against them. See: Homosexuality.	&gt; “Friendly” atheism is an atheism that allows and accepts theism not because it’s what is right, but because it’s what’s easy. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It rather sounds to me like the writer doesn't think society should allow or accept theism.
The four leading social media sites, drawn as cartoon characters. You have to love Digg's lardy ass, incoherent burbling and incontinent bowels.	I would have loved a better headline. Yours is boring.
I would say million would be enough for that to start. Custom homes are pretty high unless you have one of the sckills taht go into it: architecture, mortgages, constrution etc.  Of course you will have to earn a fair amount to upkeep taxes, maintenance, etc.	My needs are modest
&gt;Slashdot -&gt; Newsvine -&gt; Very short time with digg before -&gt; reddit. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Never even heard of newsvine	It's actually less of a social-news site, and more of a user-contributed news source (although it does link in some stuff from resources like the AP).

Well then we have different ideas of withering.  I stopped visiting digg when I saw the word gay more often than any other word.	*amazing* was the one that did that for me...
You should go to Baltimore and tell everyone there how beautiful their neighborhoods really are and how they're lucky to live there instead of some bland suburb.	A good number of them would probably agree. Not everyone is unhappy with where they're at in life.

Eh, I'm not here to discuss the quality of the humour, I'm just here to say it's pretty blatantly not a genuine call to go and murder white cis men.

You must be sheltered. I see a lot of 16 year olds and the vast majority talk much worse than that.	I'm 19, I am not vulgar at all, but I've grown up around it both at home and at school. I'm past being worried about our generation, I have just accepted the fact that a majority are pretty stupid.
Just went through **ALL** of them. All taken :( newlinechar  newlinechar And to think i was there less then 3 sec after it was posted, Ctrl + F5ing like a maniac..	Should have just had a claim key page like everybody else does &gt;.&gt; I would have easily had one
Oh trust me, she doesn't have to worry about me being stolen away by a little dog. Her lack of concern is just confidence in that she knows I'll ditch the dog in an instant. :)	Awesome!
be careful with MUA. Their eye shadow palettes tempted me and I bought 3 of them. Waste of money. The quality of shadows in the palettes is terrible compared to the singles.	Yeah, I'll definitely agree with this - the palettes are so disappointing, especially compared to the single shadows which are beautiful, and such good value.  
It must be strange seeing fat people eat junk food, have you seen drunk people drinking alcohol or smokers smoking? It'll blow your mind.	have you ever seen a grown man naked?

Yeah I got my Black Widow to VIII today and it dawned on me that I no longer needed it because the Krysae just outperforms it in every way.

Hurleys isn't really a lounge, but the corner rooms are quite, have comfy seating, and a great atmosphere. The music room and the sports room are loud as all hell, though.	hurleys is alright if you avoid the rooms in which any house band is playing.  also, the waitresses there are quite nice.

Use the agent finder and find where the Faction Navy level IVs are, you'll see very expensive battleships there doing them.

Ah, I'm sorry I assumed. If they have that kind of foundation of love for you, maybe one day they will be able to see how much you need this. 	that's kinda why this is so hard, i knew there was always a possibility that they wouldnt accept it, but i thought as loving as they had been, i hoped they would be on my side. that's why it hurts so much. 
I pray forgiveness for my crime of not knowing the name of every movie that I have ever seen.	In the jungle you must wait, until the dice read five or eight.
He can't read or write. He's illiterate. It's referenced in the show after he talks with his son about Stannis being his god, and in the books when he's Hooked on Phonics with Endric, supervised by Maester Pylos.	I know. That is why I said assuming he could he could type with little effort.
I have a shitty Jeep Grand Cherokee, so my story isn't as badass, but one time some dude in a tiny ass sedan (roughty Tercel-sized) gassed it in reverse right into me. He wedged himself underneath the front of my car and my front wheels lifted off the ground.	Someone did that to my mom in her Ranger. But it was the other way. It lifted the back tires of the ground and somehow didn't even leave a scratch. 
Yeah I did that exact same thing with mine as well. Also had the same frustration when logging into my laptop :(	I'm so glad I'm not alone in this UN tom-foolery.

Given the title of the show and the way she behaved while Discorded- packing up to leave Ponyville behind- I'd offer Solitude or Loneliness.
One of my biggest disappointments with NV was the music. I dig the Sinatra and Dean Martin, but most the country-western stuff just annoys me. Would love to be able to replace those with the music from 3. Or just more big band, Vegas style tunes. 	The music from FO3 stuck in my head a lot longer, though I did play it more. newlinechar  newlinechar Random thought - I could totally see a Sir Digby/Herbert Daring Dashwood crossover.
*POP*	I hate you.
Oh wow.... Thanks so much!	You're welcome!
have you not discovered lidls instant mash powder? just add boiling water and theres still enough in the kettle to make a mug of scald	You can't compare instant mash powder and poppys, it's like taking a bottle of expensive wine and a bottle of grape juice with vodka and calling them the same! Both good in their own right, but can't be compared as anything other than something you ingest!
Sounds like you saw the latest Saudi Drift Ejected video	Yup, no me gusta.
They had to film that scene over and over for weeks until he finally got that hand. 	That's dedication!

I agree, anytime someone like Jones makes a false prediction, we should call him on it. It's the habit of these people to slink away and change their stories after the fact. Jones does it all the time. He never admits to being flat-out wrong, which is he frequently.	While I have serious and nearly all-encompassing problems with your viewpoints re: society as expressed here on Reddit, I really do appreciate your agreement here. No one is served by sensationalist false prophets of doom. There's enough to fear in reality without making shit up.

Absolutely beautiful! Did you only have one stencil that you used over and over? The spacing is AWESOME. How'd you manage that part?	I just printed corners of where the adjacent stencils would be as a guide on the transparency. You can see it on the computer screen in the one picture. The only other thing is you have to use a level to make sure you stuck the stencil on straight

I knew it! I was thinking and I could not remeber... I looked back at your loadouts and remembered the team that all wore gibuses. I knew it! You are quite good from what I saw...	We're not the best but we have tonnes of fun and style. Mainly style.
Is that Mitt Romney?	Santorum.

Exactly. We must unite against the pizzarchy.	I... I have a confession to make. newlinechar  newlinechar I ate some pizza the other night. newlinechar  newlinechar It was delicious. :(
oh, ok. i didnt know if you used different usernames.	I know, I just thought it funny.
I seriously just sat here and laughed for like 2 minutes at this.	Tip of the day: when you enjoy a comment you can click in the upvote arrow
We didn't believe you then and we don't believe you now.	Where's Fuck_Trapped_in_Reddit when you need him?
yep. if a doctor can't be a doctor, let them at the filing jobs, or keep them at a nursing station. 	I'm sure there are plenty of other areas of medicine that wouldn't require  them to breach their ethical standards. 
Yes, but they would no longer be on Earth, so...   I fail to see the problem here.	An acceptable trade-off, I say.
I can suspend a 1-meter by 1-meter by 1-meter block of solid stone in midair. I don't think we need to be constrained by real-world gravity.	What if i replaced all the blocks with gravel, huh? where would your anti-gravity be then, huh?
Great, another unnecessarily verbose sexual story. If there's one thing /r/bestof needs, it's more of this kind of original, fresh content.	It wasn't even funny

Daaaaamn, all we need is some good decent D to go with Phaneuf and we'll be a force to reckon with next year (if this is true of course).	my brain just folded in on itself
Although I am seeking advice, a much larger part of me just wanted to say this all, so that SOMEONE out there would know the whole story. I'm already feeling a lot better of the idea of letting him just go away.	Fair enough, just remember to take the comments with a grain of salt. Or like, 50 grains of salt.

Dude. Only X inches? You should see a doctor or something. You might be a woman.	10 inches ain't that bad, dude.
Well I obviously wouldn't do it for a long exposure - that's a waste of my time, but if someone's shot involves taking a picture of me without asking first then I've no obligation, moral or legal, to let them do it. 	The picture probably isn't of you. No one gives a shit about you. Just keep walkin, dude.
People do make a big deal about it being 'The Hardest game'. It's like you said, they don't really know any different. It is hard in a good way, and rewarding, but people still freak out about it.

Faction Navy meaning under http://eve-agents.com and Faction I would choose Caldari/Gallente/Minmatar/Amarr?	There's an actual agent finder in the game now, but that'll do. I prefer Amarr/Caldari due to it's proximity to the hubs.
Is there any way to download everything on that page in one go?	If you have Firefox you can install the Download Them All extension from [http://www.downthemall.net/](http://www.downthemall.net/) All the files are Zip files so it'd be easy to configure DTA to grab them
Have you heard any memorable remarks from cashiers or fellow customers about those purchases?	Sadly we buy them online, so no. However each of the boxes comes with hundreds of 'how to use a condom' guides. 
You never get used to it.  If I were you I would abstain from all forms of physical dick pleasure for at least a week to allow your dick to reset.  It's not gonna make condom-sex suck any less, but at least you'll be able to finish.	Actually the reset button is in the rectum. But it's one of those annoying recessed buttons that you need to use a really skinny pen to press. Terrible engineering, IMO.

Try RPGMAKER if you're too lazy to do it for real, you can get it made with very little programming skill, and it's a hell of a step up from power point.	Myst was originally created in Hypercard.

Is Champion that much better than Familiar?

Also, when one grates cheese, it falls through the grater onto the other side. In this case, the computer would be full of cheese. Please, don't try this. Or do, just take pictures.	Yeah I realize I left that part out.

Do you work with other people? Also, I noticed that the things you're typing seem very telegraphic. Not trying to make an internet diagnosis, but have you been tested for Asperger's?	I have never been tested but I am familiar with it.  That would actually explain a lot of things from my childhood on.  Without telling my life story, I would say that I have a mountain of circumstancial evidence that would confirm that diagnosis.
Terraria, i play it when i feel like giving up on gaming.	Such a good game.  Terraria was what I moved to when Minecraft started getting dull, and it did not disappoint.  
Damage Done from Dark Tranquility is one of the first death metal albums I heard, and is still among my favorite to listen to all the way through. The rest of their albums never fully did it for me, but Damage Done was great. 	Damage Done is excellent, but for me The Gallery takes the cake.

You mean to tell me that this image is indeed a computer rendered image rather than a photograph?	I was analyzing it as if it was to make a point. No, that's a photo. At least, the part of me that sways my opinions so I don't feel bad about fapping to fake women says it's a photo.

A lot of factors are involved: range, powder charge, bullet weight, barrel length. I don't see it getting stuck in your head from a rifle with a high velocity round.

I disagree I come here high to look at shit high, that's the entire part of r/trees... and the legalization of trees of course.	This right here. Trees has evolved from simply tree's itself.

Oh definitely you want to turn the electric off if you shut off the inlet to the tank - but is there a specific reason to turn the electric off if you flush water out of the bottom of the unit with the inlet still open?	You need to flush with the inlet closed. If you do it with it open you'll just stir up all the sediment instead of cleaning it out. Hot water tanks fill from the bottom.
I love it. These rich, self-important fucks don't mind asking other people embarrassing questions, but they sure don't like anyone else doing it to them.	Don't worry his time will come.

Water loss on a ketogenic diet is due to less water resorption, which takes place in the kidneys. This is due to less insulin in the plasma and the increased urine output to remove ketones.

Why would it suck for the painters? They get paid again. They're working on commission. They know what's going to happen going in. Steady work is more important than pride, I'd imagine.

vines work but ladders stop arrows and signs don't take up a whole block so you'd be able to click around it and access the dispenser anyways. vines do work though which is pretty cool considering they're more likely to fit in than webs in a dungeon/temple setup.

And Vincent Li, Winnipeg,CA...  He is getting supervised leave from the center he was detained at.

Even so, I feel like it should have been left to be discussed on Deckbox. Invoking Reddit as your personal army isn't the way to do things, unless it's *really* called for (which it was not in this case).	It came from the reddit trade thread, hence the reason for the cross post. The post was absolutely warranted. The personal info was not.

Does anyone else think it's interesting that Republicans immediately jumped to the assumption that women would abort a fetus based on the fact that it was female? They specifically used the words 'little girl' instead of 'little boy' or even just 'fetus'.	I do have qualms with the use of 'little girl' as opposed to foetus or another term--but girls are far more likely to be the ones aborted in sex selective abortions, so they're being pretty spot on with the gender claim.

My point is that people argue that there are religious implications in our unique qualities of logic and empathy.

Right, it's only a matter of degrees but difficult to call any of those qualities unique unless you use a very narrow definition of them. But even if you could show that we do have unique qualities that still wouldn't mean they originate from religion.

Not sure if anyone finds this interesting, but I think economists have taken the roles previously filled by philosophers.  Political decisions and general social behavior are guided more on economic principle and what economists are saying than what philosophers are saying.	I wouldn't say economists are the only people guiding public policy.  However, I think economists seem to care more about concepts of tradeoffs, feasibility, and incentives more than philosophers do.  Those are really important for analyzing public policy.

It's as if the Suwon torso murder never happened.	He was 'Chinese Korean' not *Korean* Korean...

HEY Rose and Bernard were AWESOME...at least Rose was...	I actually agree. I found them both very likable characters. It doesn't change that they were pretty much a boring old retired couple after the fifth season. That isn't a bad thing though. They found their place. I was very satisfied with their character arcs. 
Okay dumb question time! Do you just buy a head of iceberg and peel off the leaves, or is this packaged specially somehow?	Using running water you can get the leaves off of the head intact more easily. Just fill up the space between leaves with water and they will tend to separate.
I'm sure somewhere nearby there's a perfectly separate but equal establishment for bears of color to congregate.	That's not the point.  Bears of every color should be able to shit in the woods, the same woods.

The idea of child support, at least where I live is to... you know... support the child. The child you created. You're right - it does take two to tango. Maybe you shouldn't tango if you don't like the possible consequences.	But people DO that anyway, and that's the whole issue with abortion. It's technically their faul (unless they were raped), and they should have ti deal with it.

Never heard them, but I'm liking it already, you just want someone else to take control while you relax in the 'backseat'.	Exactly. It's the story of someone learning to retake control of their life after someone close to them dies. It's a beautiful song, from a beautiful album.
And Roseart. Fuck that noise.	Fucking Roseart crayons were the worst. You could get better results coloring with candles.
Checked the package again. I done goofed up good, apparently; the nutrition info is for 13 shrimp PLUS 4 tsp of the cocktail sauce that is packaged along with the shrimp. I didn't see this little tidbit. This is fantastic. I feel fantastic about this. Thanks so much.	We all have carb-panic moments, it's ok.
That episode has another one of my favorite moments, when George is frantically yelling over the phone to Jerry, and Jerry just responds 'Who is this?'	'**JERRYYYYYY!!!**'
Any concerns about letting Limbo in despite the fact that it's just the Windows game + Wine? That sounds like a really dangerous precedent to me.	How is it dangerous? There's nothing wrong with WINE.
Posted from the toilet, huh	Actually.. Yes.. It wasn't pretty.. 
Oh wow thanks! I didn't know there was a subreddit for this!	Happy to help.  :)
Cool, I prefer double tap 165 gold dots for my glock 20.	I'll have to test some of that once I get around to replacing the recoil spring. It's not wanting to return to battery lately on the hot loads.
There's no way you're gonna have 'the body of a weight lifter' in 5 months. Lift weights, and you'll love the results. SS is about 10 bucks on amazon kindle, I got the PC app and it works great.	OK.

I'm not sure you're understanding what you're reading. 	he is not and I would be interested in where he got that from.
Down voted because you ruined the game I meant to finish for the past month!	Shit, my bad man. I fixed it for others but still hehe sorry. Did I just spoil Skyrim?
Thanks! So far there are a few answers that I'm a tiny bit surprised  by, but there isn't much data yet. I'll be happy to post the results.	I'm also interested in the results :) newlinechar  newlinechar Don't worry about the counts right now, it's only been out an hour. Check it sometime tomorrow, I'm sure there'll be plenty!

Not exactly, report cards that are filled with NHI/INC 's (in place of zeros) generally are treated as 'unable to assess' and don't reflect a change either way.  But, I think you are fairly close to the mark with the last bit.	Yes but if the students would be getting 0% or low percentages, they bring the average down.  If they are not assessed and receive a 'null' they don't count towards the average. (e.g. average of 0%, 90%, 90% is 60%; average of null, 90%, 90% is 90%.) 
I'll save mine for Ramparts, meself	Woody Harrelson approves
Once something awesome goes on for half an hour of the movie, it isn't awesome anymore.	When you're 14 years old and see it in the movie theatre, it's the best thing ever. Not so great on the small screen, but definitely one of the most exciting moments of my childhood movie-going experience. 
the jockey ship in this is not the same one that is in alien. Awesome movie, its just left so many questions to answer!	Yeh it's almost definitely a different ship, I liked the primitive Xenomorph too. 
Single player games without connecting to the internet?  What do you think this is, 1972?	I know, it's absurd.  Imagine how much better pong would have been if you had to login to play it. newlinechar

You've done the right thing, using the venue (FB) available to you. There's nothing to feel guilty about.  newlinechar  newlinechar Your friendship with Dan is toast, but it was burnt anyway, and burnt toast isn't anything you should be keeping.	I agree.

Who the fuck cares what the founding fathers envisioned? They probably would have had no problem with everyone owning slaves: doesn't mean we have to adhere to that standard of morals.	^ Also works for WWJD.
I thought it was due to the depletion of glycogen stores? Glycogen causes water retention, and carbs are stored as glycogen. is that not correct?	you are both correct, but most of the water loss is due to glycogen loss. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar remember that most low carb diets are not ketogenic.
Yeah, you put some tofu and sliced leek in there and it's awwright.	Mhmmmm, cheap, and simple to make (I make kimchee twice a month, and this is where all my super ripe stuff goes!)
The other comments in this thread made me feel less manly.  This comment is so relieving to hear (Asian male here).	They're silly. Masculinity has nothing to do with the number of hair follicles on your body. :)
You're awful mad at someone just trying to do their job.	I had no problem with that. It was the fact that we were 8 years old and she treated us like we were paid actors on the set of Star Wars. 
Right. Back away from the fucking book, Darr. This can't end well.	Hey!  Just a question. . . Not like I was REALLy going to 'throw the book at them' &gt;:) newlinechar  newlinechar Well. . . unless it's negotiated.

moodily browsing reddit looking for sad threads to relate to and whine on.	Why so sad cumdumpling?
It happens bro. Anything that actually makes sense on here is downvoted, while anything that is blindly praising the game is upvoted.	You're kidding?  I've seen many criticisms of the game upvoted and pleas to at least give it a chance before judging new content downvoted to oblivion.  
Of course. Inevitable. Reddit tripping over itself to get nudes. Fuck all of you.	'pm me please!'
Dude way off topic, but I just realized who you are. I love your blog. Have several of the cheat sheets on the wall of my office. Thanks.	Do share. Which blog? Where blog? Am always looking for places where I cam learn.

The primitivist, on the other hand, has a rather substantial historical basis to back up his 'property norms,' while the voluntaryist has only an epistemological one.	Can you elaborate?
You can see this in Toronto, too, with the [old stock exchange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Toronto_Stock_Exchange.jpg). I think it's a pretty good way of preserving the old building while still allowing for urban 'densification'.	Looks nice
Can't you guys come up with a single new joke?  Ever?	OP is a fag.
So. Apply anyway. The object of the application process is to land an interview. No one is going to laugh in your face for applying to a job you're 'technically' not qualified for.

Hey, I appreciate you taking the time to write out these long responses. They were really insightful!	You're welcome. It's somewhat of a passion of mine (obviously) and knowledge is the best weapon for fighting pet overpopulation!
I bet the voice over for 'Error' would sound just as corny as the overpronounced 'Terror'	I pictured his personal 'Realm of Terror' theme park, complete with a water slide and a kid's pool. Laughed my ass off the first time I heard it.
I think it's that this is not necessarily a zombie situation, but quite possibly a contagious neurovirus capable of making us crazy as hell. Because it seems like a lot of people are biting each other and tearing into each other, literally. Ever seen Pontypool?	im a little worried, i hope its not in a food we are all eating. newlinechar 
Nothin', but as a human I don't need to be the ideal in order to judge others against it.	Fair enough. I disagree with your opinion but you are most certainly entitled to it.

No, unfortunately the economic crash in 2008 impacted quite a few projects, and that was one of them.  Hopefully sometime in the future it will be possible. I think it would make a great graphic novel!	Augh, that is really too bad. I agree, the writing is so visual it would be awesome to see the story unfold in images.
Get active when you smoke instead of potato couching it. If I have nothing to do besides getting/being high I will eventually unhinge my jaw and swallow my fridge whole. 	Any time I take ONE bite of anything to stop the munchies, I just end up turning my kitchen into Golden Corral. It really is just self-control.
I love people like you who think people like that sick fuck can be changed. 	It's just a lot easier to kill them and forget what made them the way they are right?

'Yo sé español' or 'Yo sé hablar español'.

They don't have to always paint skeptics in a bad light and exalt the concept of faith to move a story along, however.	They did the ol' 'question nothing' switcheroo. Mulder was supposed to be the 'skeptic' for questioning orthodoxy, while Scully was the status-quo. They just ignored rationality in the process, which is the problem, and ends up supporting fantastic beliefs.
Just ask anyone where they think potatoes came from!   newlinechar  newlinechar Sure wasn't Ireland.	My personal favorite is Bananas, the ultimate in 'Intelligent Design'.

jinro would win more games if he stopped playing macro with bad macro builds and committed to more cheeses, timing attacks and all ins. newlinechar 	Agreed, he's got some pretty funky micro sometimes, which shines more in cheese/all ins.
You said you've been doing it for a year, right? Cause the shows have been out for way more than a year...	'Professionally' for a year, I say that because that's when I started WickedFinds and registered it as a busniess, and that's when I started the dedicated Ebay page. I've been buying and selling stuff in my spare time for a while, but not to the quantity that I do now.
thanks for the advice! and thanks for the vote of confidence as well	Anytime my friend. 
Wow, the locking mechanism is kind of, you know, the biggest selling point of the whole thing.  How did you even find about them without being told about the lock?

Really? I think fedoras are fucking sexy.	Yeah, back in the 50s where people wore suits or trenchcoats with them. Now, they're essentially douche beacons with these people wearing them with t-shirts, skinny jeans and all that stuff. It doesn't look good at all unless the fedora is paired with said suit or trenchcoat.
I sure don't. Bunch of kids. But I'm also religious, so nah. I like being a mod on this reddit. Nice and civil. 	As long as your religion isn't a major one, specifically Christianity, you'll probably be okay on r/atheism. newlinechar  newlinechar That SR isn't so much atheistic as it is anti-Christian.

Qbank is superb for level 1 but for Levels 2 and 3 you really gotta do the hardest ones, aka the item sets.  I would suggest doing 3 full practice exams and recognizing where you need work with 1-2 weeks to spare before exam day	Too late for that!
That's another good question. I don't remember his reaction to the Red Wedding or if there was one.  newlinechar  newlinechar Or are you asking if he had a hand in planning the RW? 	I'm asking the later, but I'm curious about the former.

oohhhh. that's why i feel a million times faster on naut after i get boots, i know it's the same change as other champions but it feels like it makes so much of a difference with naut, same with cho.	What I'd like now is for Riot to go back and start tweaking older champions, adding lines and animations here and there, kind of like these two. Like Wukong's cloud of resting.

Belmont &amp; Girard, I don't think too many Penn students are in that area.	That's not the correct zip code; Google Maps will point you to 1230 North 45th street if you copy/paste the address directly, because it wants to find something in 19104. 1230 South 45th is in 19143.

What language you learning? I think it's probably one of the best bits of language learning software I've used. I usually give up on most pretty quickly as they're boring. This is almost 'social language learning', having friends who learn as well and you can kind of compete.	I'm learning Spanish.

I heard they removed the sharpshooters from the free rotation, but I guess not. Now I can test my TF2 Sniper hat on him and see what he's like! (and hopefully this update doesn't bring any more aimbots)	The general consensus is that since now that Uber has a report function, they can put Sharpshooters back on the rotation and players can just report aimbotters if they crop up.
I think that Disney has a better overall presentation, but Universal probably has better individual rides.  Neither place can touch Cedar Point on roller coasters.  That place ruins everything else. 	Oh you're just gonna go for the grand poobah like that? Just gonna throw out Cedar Point? That's like saying 'Tofu and rice are okay but neither hold a candle to bacon.'
I don't do the Svunt shake, I do the one just above it. Either way, I use chocolate. It mixes really well with the peanut butter and nutella. Tasty. 	I just drank the Svunt one.

I figured it was either him, or Dominique Straus-Kahn (sp?), neither of whom had diplomatic immunity and neither of whom were actively protected by the French government. Also neither of whom were convicted of rape, so yay!	Polanski was indicted for rape among other things.  He agreed to a plea bargain but then fled the country before the plea was finalized.  So no, he was never convicted.  Because he ran away and hid.  **Not** because he was found not guilty.

What level, and where do you live? Depends heavily on that. In my area, EMT-B's aren't hired at all, and it's difficult to get on an ALS truck as an EMT.

It all makes sense now.	Round an round and round we go...
McAcee? MCAFEE?!?!	I use McAfee... what should I be using instead?
You can put an inspirational quote or create your own motto. Or, you can put the name of your alma mater underneath to score some alumni points. 	I like quotes! newlinechar  newlinechar Can you put.... 'future social worker at your firm' hehe
Oh you're just gonna go for the grand poobah like that? Just gonna throw out Cedar Point? That's like saying 'Tofu and rice are okay but neither hold a candle to bacon.'	Well, Disney World is like a four course meal with gourmet everything, while Cedar Point is like a pile of bacon. The overall experience of going to Disney is better, but bacon is cheaper and it's bacon.
The only ads I've seen are flash ads.  Are there really commercials?	my little brother said he saw an advert for runescape on cartoon network, and i seen other people say it. newlinechar  newlinechar dunno whats in the advert, probs part of the runescape cinematic which makes the game look better than it is :p

Oh. Désolé.	C'est qu'il est poli ce type, quand on s'y adresse en français du moins!
It was Dave Ellefson, right?	Congratulations, everyone - we made it a whole seven comments related to Metallica before someone brought up Megadeth, besting the previous record by two.

It takes a real man to compliment another man's cock.  newlinechar 	Or a gay man. newlinechar  newlinechar Though, of course, that is not to say that a gay man and a real man are a mutually exclusive package (ba-dum tshhh).  Nor is it mutually inclusive.

SHOE THE SUE MAKER	Tony Schumacher?
I'm no artist either so I too stand in utter amazement the next morning examining my clean apartment and a freshly baked cake. :-)	You got me beat on the baking. I have no concept for that. I do really really get into my cooking of spicy food though. When I am cooking that is, lately it's been automotive work. 
Jon isn't dead. In an interview with some sort of magazine (I forget which one) they asked GRRM 'Why did you kill off Jon Snow?' newlinechar He replied: 'Oh so you think he's dead, do you?'	That doesn't mean he's alive either. That was, by definition, a non-answer. It was in fact a question, meant to mess with the interviewer's (and by extension the readers') head. 
B.C.	I don't think the color grey existed back then.
That was the table I used for my Ninja Turtle figures!	You used it for your Barbies.  newlinechar  newlinechar Admit it.   
I feel like there's something wrong with me because the idea of a Mario Kart blowjob was by far the most exciting thing I read.	Nothing wrong with you, I'm just as excited about giving my partner a Mario Kart blowjob.

If you're going to advertise it at a Linux port, having it just be a wine wrapper feels lazy. I could just as easily install it in wine myself.	I don't really agree. If it's fully WINE-compatible, then it's fully Linux-compatible. It just has WINE as a dependency. Would you say the same about Minecraft? It's written in Java and requires the JRE (a compatibility layer, if defined loosely).
How do you get 50 Jews into a Volkswagen?  newlinechar  newlinechar In the ashtray. newlinechar  newlinechar 	The gas tank works well too. (Hardy har har)

For me its YOLO, to which i shout back, 'You obviously lack originality!' 	Heard that for the first time a couple days ago, but since then I've heard it at least 15 times. That'll be a good one to remember when I really start getting burned out on that
You can never fap too much! newlinechar Edit: once I went on a fapping marathon, and my Dick went a little crooked. So I took a break.	That's... wow... *nice*
Or Caramel Lattes	and ~~meth~~ gas. newlinechar  newlinechar Don't forget the gas.
If memory serves, it wasn't really that bad.  The biggest problem I remember was with bluescreens (and other crashes).  I mostly played SimCity 3000 on it though, no fancy stuff.	Yeah, after a few patches, it wasn't really more or less horrible than Windows 98, but like Vista, the damage was already done and nobody really trusted it.

FratTip: We put a like 8 handles in and a few containers of Instant Kool-Aid and fill up the keg 1/2 with water, then roll it around on the ground to mix it all.	I am not saying my frat puts ecstasy and Xanax in our jungle juice but we put ecstasy and Xanax in our jungle juice.
Funny enough even surgical sterilization has a tiny percentage of failure. 	[Life finds a way](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkWeMvrNiOM)
My kids could easily stream me to the poor house cruising down the interstate with 4G LTE Netflix streaming	They'll realize Netflix doesn't work and will browse YouTube instead. Now what? newlinechar  newlinechar Seems like disabling 4G is a more sensible approach.
Oh man.	Oh god. OH MAN.
Estoy totalmente de acuerdo, y tambien me parece que se equivoca cuando dice que se usa al sub como mirror de la nacion, me parece que no es asi y se postean noticias de sitios que la verdad que muchas veces no conozco.	Eso. Igualmente, que hay de malo que se posteen links de La Nación. Yo ya lo leo al diario, pero acá también importan las discusiones que se dan entre los redditors. Hay comentarios con contenido, comentarios que me hacen reir. 
Every time I read that blog it's like a smug circle jerk. I wonder how the tone will change when Fweddit is pressing its collective dick against the glass of Minmatar stations.	Thank you for that thrilling and titillating image.
This sounds incredibly similar to our own historical behavior.......	Minus the bit about avoiding obesity newlinechar  newlinechar  
This is really the only way to properly run the subreddit. On my other account, I *ban* these assholes, but I'm not a mod here... yet.	And yet, BoomBoomYeah's comment is being upvoted. Go figure.
I still have my Chansey wind-up toy! Played the fuck out of that thing.	It was extremely hard to get that Chansey top to spin right. However, the Magnemite top perfectly fit my hand and spun hardcore.
Actually, they're not.  I've gotten five times the karma for good movie trivia than I've gotten for boobs. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Before anyone else looks, I'm not dumb enough to post remotely-erotic pictures of myself on my main account.  Don't waste your time.	But, but, you've never posted in r/gonewild and the one boobs shot (lovely by the way) was not exactly in an erotic context. I'm not saying you should test N69's hypothesis (you can if you want), but you certainly haven't disproved it.
i am also due jully 11th and this is scaring me, makes it feel so close/ real!  just wanna wish you the best of luck chicka, keep us updated! 	Will do and thanks! Just a really longggggg day!
We're like, a huge beach with some grass.	I don't know if it's the sleep deprivation that made this comment hilarious or if it was genuinely funny.
The first three of these are upvoted, but after that they're all downvoted.  Damn it, Reddit, how do you decide which one to upvote and which one to downvote?	I usually throw darts at the screen.
Alien Blue? newlinechar Edit: it lets me edit. See, SEE!	No he is called 'Reddit' or something like that. 
Hahahah I have an old diamondback from the 70's-80's when they still put the diamond in the frame. Just thought I'd share w/ u lol	I still have some in my garage so its very relevant. :)
ITS RAINING	HOW CONVENIENT
Randomly selected other creature takes it's place	Does anyone know why it replaces creatures? I'm assuming it's because they're in your library but are banned from spore.
Quality, not quantity. 	haha, you brought it up!
You just have to get good at passing it off like you knew it all along.  A little 'Yeah, that's right bitches' smirk and you're in the other team's heads.	I liked to do a good golf clap at the end of the game if we more than doubled the other teams score :D
Wings fan here. Was expecting a somewhat easy game for Detroit, but now this makes it interesting. Can't wait!	Why exactly were you expecting an easy game? Since the lockout the Wings are 2-3-1 against the Leafs. It's been fairly even I'd say.
I agree, maybe choose a soft gray and accessorize with pinks and yellows?	Yeah definitely! I saw a gorgeous picture of gray dresses with yellow bouquets. (I tried to find it, but of course I can't now!) newlinechar  newlinechar I even think the royal blue she was mentioning would still be pretty.
I powerleveled through Bastion and had friends kill diablo for me. I used some gear I found from butcher runs to let me steamroll Act1 and first half of Act 2. Afterwards I had to use AH. I spent ~1 mil on all my current gear.	Any pointers on an efficient DH Siegebreaker run? I'm kinda at a loss when it comes to where to start, what side-bosses to include etc. Thanks!
Trans Girls, transform and ROLL OUT!	It's Morphin' Time!

And besides, who the fuck would want to live on Mars? Looks like a hole to me.	People don't even want to live in the australian outback... or on sea colonies... why the hell would they go to mars?
People have told me it's offensive so I figured I would share haha. Share with all your friends.	Already shared it with one. ;)
Not only that but I want it to be available on all carriers. Not just one carrier. newlinechar  newlinechar I would hate to have it only on at&amp;t while on tmobile. newlinechar  newlinechar something like that and i'd leave android in a heart beat	Agreed.  I'm still using the HD7.
I love how they do this as soon as the SGS3 was launched.  newlinechar  newlinechar Still waiting for my N7000 ICS 	Source dropped for Note ICS like last week.

dude, you aren't going to *die.* I mean I suppose a lot of folks will, but it's not like an asteroid is coming to wipe us out. Just... aquire assets that will help you live, invest in things you probably already own being in /r/collapse, and you'll be fine.	It would be rough but at the same time I don't really see a lot of opportunity in the current system for normal working class people like myself so whatever. Go for it. Hit the reset button. 
South* of Mena newlinechar 	I happen to be from that area. I knew the truck looked familiar. I think there is another quite similar to it down further south. If I see it again, I'll post a picture.
definitley, I basically use reddit for r/nfl and r/chibears for sports news, anything else, especially the main subs, make me barf.	/r/chibears is the best team subreddit I'm a member of. People are mostly positive and real submissions, not bullshit imgur links. 
May I see some of your work? newlinechar  newlinechar Oh yea, and /r/MLPdrawingschool 	[Here](http://seenotc.deviantart.com/gallery/37007121) are all the sketches I've done recently, and [here](http://seenotc.deviantart.com/gallery/37007116) are some custom toys I'm pretty proud of.

Upvote for the rooted Kindle Fire. What CM9 ROM are you running? I'm currently running GedeRom w/ Hascode's latest kernel and it is pretty damn close to perfect. Gotta upvote you for the G2, as well.

Why use crutches to teach a baby to walk when it has two capable legs?	Alternatively: why bother walking in a world made of jetpacks? newlinechar  newlinechar Besides, if they can achieve lucidity with 'crutches' and then pick up good habits, they could eventually shed that crutch and still be more successful than someone who hadn't build said habits yet.
My friend introduced me to Hedegaard a few weeks ago via this remix. He's got some awesome stuff. I also really like his moombahton remix of 'Move Bitch' by Ludacris. 	Couldn't decided which one to post first! That one will definitely be up at some point
Not me, but I live a quarter mile from there. 	same here.... dad?

I mention I am an ent on other subreddits; 'Re-evaluate your life' followed by 15+ downvotes. newlinechar  newlinechar :(	Yeah. This is why I really hate commenting on anything in the rest of reddit. An argument on trees tends to be more civil than a normal discussion on the rest of reddit. Too much hate and judgement in this world man.
We can do it Beelz. LET'S MAKE THE NEXT FACEBOOK	Ok, but we need to have a strict division of labour to work most efficiently. How about you do all the coding, and I'll make all the money?
Minecraft scares me lol. Im too scared to download this game	Don't worry little boy, it will be a grand adventure. Go on, try it.
Compared to San Angelo TX water, anything tastes good. Even your balls, I'm sure.	West Texas water is just unequivocally shit.
Am I missing something, or are the first and third examples exactly the same? 	They look the same, but the cases are different. It's hard to explain if you're unfamiliar with German grammar, but the possesive form ending is the same for these two cases (for the specific gender x755x uses).
in all seriousness though, I absolutely hate talking about soccer with u.s. citizens who only follow epl and refuse to follow mls. They want soccer to be big here in the states but don't support stateside clubs.  newlinechar  newlinechar it is literally my biggest pet peeve right now.	BUT HERP DERP CHELSEA DERPY ARSENAL!!!!
Is that a hamburger?	It could actually be a cheeseburger.
Yup, as an AD all I'm doing when farming is trying to make my CS score nice and pretty, not at all trying to salvage what's left of our late game for what I'm guessing is a failing team.	I'm talking about players that do this lategame, you know, when your team needs you the most.
Are you blind? If so, how are you reading this question? I'm guessing someone is reading it to you?	He/she could be a bartender, cook or janitor. Only the waiters are blind I think. 
I wouldn't consider it their best, but I would rate it very near the top. It gets a bad rap for bringing the tribal and groove elements more up front, but it's still a very respectable slab of thrash metal IMO. 	Well, I'm drawn towards Igor Cavalera's drum work on Chaos A.D., which remains a big inspiration to me. 
I got them at Macy's	Clearly, you are a smart shopper.
A loser is a loser, doesn't matter if they are high, drunk or sober. 	Precisely
[This is where I got my info](http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/about-vitamin-d/what-is-vitamin-d/vitamin-d-toxicity/). Blame them.	I dont blame you. Stupid internet. I have seen people go toxic from Vit D. They should seek medical attention right away. Could cause organ damage.

I don't get it. Can somebody please explain what I'm supposed to be looking at here?	There's only two games on the out of town scoreboard. Hence, crickets.
The homeless man also had prior convictions for violent crimes, while the CEO cooperated with the police and led to arrests of more people involved in the scheme. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't have the sources on hand, but this has been posted and discussed many times before. 	http://www.snopes.com/politics/crime/roybrown.asp newlinechar  newlinechar That's some of it.

GPA matters for getting your first job or internship. After that, you have professional references that are more important that GPA.	Agreed (Cal Poly ME Grad '10). Get involved in clubs/campus life to aid in acquiring internships/professional experience. My resume was fairly standard for an ME student but it was my involvement in Engineering Ambassadors that helped me stand out and get my job in Sales Engineering. 
That would be terribly unfortunate unless the keyboard managed to produce a high pitched female sound as the ultimate.	Opera Sona ult: Sona magically recovers her voice and produces a high pitched sound that stuns all enemies in front of her.

So, this is the 'left anarchists have a monopoly on the word anarchist' argument again?	As far as they have a monopoly on the history of anarchism and its development, yes. I'm not going to forcibly stop someone from calling themselves an anarchist, but I don't think I have especially high-standards at all when it comes to a basic understanding of anarchism.

As much as I like GB and am glad e-sports leagues got a major partner, I don't think having such a huge portion of the gaming media under the umbrella of one company is a good thing.

There was something on that cosmopolitan website about sliding a donut around a dick and then having a girl bite it off and eat it. That better be one damn good donut.	hmm I tried that once, the donut doesn't fit, and i got glaze in my hair. Plus donut + dick isn't the tastiest combo.

Who cares if it's for advertisement or not? They're a business, of course the move is calculated to make them money. At the end of the day it still goes towards 'normalising' the concept of a gay relationship in the eyes of the public which is a good thing.	Absolutely.  Just because they're benefiting from it too doesn't make it a bad thing.  Hell, let's hope it catches on, unless it comes to the point where businesses are publicly supporting the issue and then turning around and funding anti-gay shit.

I'm from New Zealand. We're too far away from any team worth playing except Australia, who are quite a way ahead of us.

Where are you moving to? The front range is very different from the mountains. The western slope has its own thing going too.	Even a difference in 500 feet can mean as much as 6 more inches.

The team he scored for (Fk Buducnost from Podgorica, Montenegro) had the league won already before the game, so I guess the referee just called it knowing the fans were two seconds away from storming the pitch.

I still don't understand why LS and jinro goes mech in TvP, I watch both their streams and they never seem to win with it, even when they have a clear advantage. :p	Didn't LS say in one of his vlogs that mech absolutely sucks and has no future and you should go bio TvP.
I don't really agree. If it's fully WINE-compatible, then it's fully Linux-compatible. It just has WINE as a dependency. Would you say the same about Minecraft? It's written in Java and requires the JRE (a compatibility layer, if defined loosely).	If that's the case, would you say everything with a gold or platinum rating on the AppDB could be considered a native linux version?
To be fair I've never seen them suggest losing weight to anyone, 'fat shaming' is a big no-no there. Even their fitness subreddit consists almost entirely of articles saying that it's healthy to be fat, haha.	Fiancee and I had a good laugh over this.

And a cantata is, except for being mostly in song, what you want to hear when you go to a concert and want the band to play from their latest album.	So cantatas were a medely of popular tunes?

So very true. I just got back from a road trip in Europe and the adherence to the 'keep right, pass left' rule makes highway driving so much better. 	Well i meant the training. There, they teach you how to drive a car on public roads. Here, we are taught how to park, and off we go. Of course, there are far fewer accidents on the autobahn than on our speed limited highways, but infrastructure isn't the main problem.

I was never in the Marines, or any armed forces for that matter but Ooh fuckin rah. All of the ones I've met were badasses, or quiet badasses. The quiet ones are always the ones you have to look out for (if you're a criminal that is :P)	The inverse is really more true:  it's the loud ones who are full of shit. newlinechar  newlinechar The guy at the bar claiming he's special forces is usually the same guy with a stupid look on his face when you ask him who he deployed with.

I didn't have time to read anything, but my 2 cents is this... John Olerud was one of the last players that was grandfathered in to wear his no flap batting and fielding helmet.

An emu stole a sandwich out of my hand when i was 4.	HAHA I just laughed really hard at this.

Yeah Swain is receiving some major QoL and ability buffs. But outside of him and Renekton it seems to be nerfs all around. I like to see a balance of nerfs and buffs every patch. Maybe they will be adding more buffs to other champs before next patch.	Well, what would you like being buffed, not counting reworks (like stealth, Karma, etc).  I personally can't think of much, everything seems relatively balanced.
Zetterberg, next question	I honestly don't think a Swedish Captain will work in Detroit......

Yeah, I look at this and wonder what my sophomore self was thinking. I guess I have the excuse of almost no programming experience at that point, but still.

Obviously those cities are of key interest in the DLC but there's nothing more we can speculate than that.
We don't responde so we can make fun of you.	You guys are pure evil. Makes us feel awkward as hell.
If that's the case, would you say everything with a gold or platinum rating on the AppDB could be considered a native linux version?	It depends. Are those apps supported by the developer? Are they tailored for WINE? If yes, then the argument could be made. If no, then not quite. It just happens to be compatible.
And 100% of computer users pirate music. 	I just use a youtube playlist, which is more of a loophole than pirating.
Walmart wasn't always huge, but they've always had the same pricing policy.  	Their motto/mission statement is not in anyway a pricing policy. There's a huge difference in selling perishables vs. selling durable goods like textiles. Which is why an everyday low price with Walmart can succeed and places like JC Penny and Sears fail trying to do something similar. 
I wouldn't run 2008R2 as a workstation OS....	Not saying it's the *best* idea, just saying it's possible. With the proper configuration, you can make 2008R2 act pretty much identically to 7.

Yeah, PayPal is also a problem.  I hope you have a separate bank account linked to it, because PayPal sometimes will have it closed. I know a few people who won't keep more than $1,000-$2,000 in their acct because of the shady PayPal practices. 	We usually only keep $1000 in paypal, for busniess purchases. We use the paypal debit cards often. But as soon as we get a big score, or the balance exceeds $2000 it usually goes into the bank! That has saved our butts more than I'd like

Gah. I was trying to avoid things from that thread [](/smith) newlinechar  newlinechar I could just tell from the title it'd be too gross.	Along with the 'What's the most politically incorrect/controversial/asnine belief you have?' these threads appear weekly - they actually serve no purpose because funnily enough; we're the only ones who read them - everyone else just wants to join the dagpile and post their own fucked up thoughts for validation.

Nice. Why is he called '10 guy?' I've never understood this.	People in the r/trees subreddit rate themselves from a [1] to a [10] to describe how high they are while posting or how high they were in a story.

Really? How many times have atheists knocked on your door to share the good news about Dawkins and how many times have you been handed literature by atheists about their non-faith in the streets?

That does seem to explain it quite well. It never ceases to amaze me how good christians are at cherry picking parts of the Bible that support their opinions and completely ignoring the parts of the Bible that don't support them.	That is one of my biggest pet peeves

Some STDs can still transfer even with using a condom.	Yes, but mostly things like genital warts that extend beyond the condom. These sorts are usually visible (thus why good prostitutes see value in a visual inspection). So yes, using a condom is not perfect, but doesn't present that great a risk that it is worth not having sex.
Gnosis is the greek noun for 'knowledge'. Any 'Gnostic' is someone claiming to know. In the case of Gnostic Christians, they claimed to know the supreme ruler of the earth (and in some cases thought it was a different god to the creator god).	I'm aware. It just seems like the mysticism sense has been used for a long time whereas using it to mean the opposite of agnosticism is very very recent. Possibly an Internet neologism.

the spy's sapper is selected similarly to the engie's buildings, (sentry is build 2 0 and a sapper is build 3 0), so probably a glitch where it counted each sapper as a building.	Or it was during the brief period where spy could build dispensers.

No, when two things of different temperatures are isolated in a calorimeter, they equalize to the same temperature between the two originals. Doesn't matter which is added to which.	This is true.  To add to that always remember that cold is just the absence of heat.  Therefore it doesn't affect the accuracy of the heat gain/loss.

I have the x4 955 and haven't had a single issue with it.  Skyrim/COD/Quake all run stable on ultra-settings.	I've heard the AMD x4 processors actually do better as gaming processors. Unfortunately, when buying my PC I made the assumption that six cores means better than four.
i personally liked that with every puzzle you solve you're gifted with some witty dialogue from GladOS. There was a point where the puzzles were alright and all but I just wanted to listen to the next thing she had to say.	Then I imagine you love Portal 2 more than the first one. Felt like they focus more on story and flow and save their brainbuster puzzles for the co-op.

They would be ignorant; Personally having followed both sports and esports they are almost identical forms of entertainment.

Calculus is calculus; the concept remains the same. Limits, derivatives, and integrals don't all of a sudden follow different rules when you jump from a high school course to a college level course. 	Yes, but the pace at which it's taught can be different. High school generally moves slower because they spend time reviewing material from previous classes (trig, algebra, etc.).

Still, just look up a video of Puddle, it looks cool.	True the retro looking games are everywhere right now. I don't mind the style, but it is over used. Puddle is fun, tough but so rewarding when you finally beat a level.

Yeah, Westport used to be it's own town. It's streets were aligned to the Santa Fe trail, I think. Isn't it the other way around: missouri built magnetic north/south (the only technology at the time), and kansas built geographic north/south decades later?
I believe Pozzatto was held back from a few races last year because he intended to leave Katusha. Also, one of the Sulzberger brothers (can't remember which) complained about not getting support in races because it was expected he would leave to GreenEDGE.	Makes you wonder if Nibali even has a chance at this years Tour de France. You'd think it'd be smarter to just 'hold' transfer discussions until after the race you're aiming at for the year, but I guess it's really not that easy.

Then how was I right?	you were right that the jeep in the article does not have power windows, you're comment is framed to make it sound like all wranglers dont have power windows, which is wrong
the funny thing is, due to capacity ability, that is where the government would set up if it set up locally.	You just have to wait out the government newlinechar 
Nice dish! Did he ever come? (No pun intended :) newlinechar 	Yes. Yes I did ;)
Why should I be a 'man' if I have no testicles, have tits, female hormones, feminine features, no adam's apple, etc.? I guess you could say I'm neither, but I'd rather be she than 'it'.	I thought you weren't taking hormones? How do you have no testicles, have tits, female hormones, feminine features, no adam's apple, etc.?
The thing is that most of the religious bigots that blindly follow their beliefs rather than listen to science, logic, and reason are not intelligent enough to realize what a stillborn really is...	a dead baby?
&gt;Sting? He has more history with WWE than he does with TNA. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Um....	WCW is owned by WWE so therefore, he is apart of WWE's history.

Oh shut the fuck up. Parting, Hero, Squirtle, MC, Oz, Puzzle, Genius. It's not hard to name a bunch of popular Korean Protosses. People like you casually tossing around accusations of racism propagate racism more than anyone. newlinechar  newlinechar HwangSin is an unfortunate victim of caster bias. That's it.	I think he's just saying that if Hwangsin were not Korean, he would get much more attention and appreciation, which is probably true. I dunno whether it's proper to use a word as strong as 'racism' to refer to that, though.

Since you can't be charged twice for the same crime and he was released from prison, is he safe? newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not a lawyer and my knowledge is pretty limited on a situation like this. 	He completed his sentence, so it doesn't really matter any more (as far as jail time).   newlinechar    newlinechar He wasn't let out because of her changing her story, and he won't be put back in for her changing it again.
Do the other scars look like the one you posted? How long were you in the hospital?	Yeah, they're all similar. One is longer, the rest are shorter. I was in hospice for about a month.
Of course some people who believe that they have a lactose intolerance are actually allergic to casein which is always in every dairy product.	Some people are more sensitive to the fat globules in milk and can more easily process dairy that is either low fat or has smaller globules, eg goat.

When I saw they were playing on hardwood I instantly thought of FIFA street which Messi is on the cover of. Than I saw their dribbling and thought, 'this must bring back street ball memories of them playing'. I would have loved to have gone to that match.	It must be the most festive yet relaxed atmosphere ever. Because no matter who scores its awesome. 
To be fair most girls are horrible at their hints 	This. Usually because of mixed signals. If you can't hint, try just being honest.

What's more fun than a dead baby hanging from a ceiling fan? Hitting it with a shovel every time it comes around.	What's the difference between a truck full of bowling balls and a truck full of dead babies? You can't unload a truck full of bowling balls with a pitchfork.

No, they put every World Cup game on the station in 2010. 	Okay, once every four years, soccer jumps above third their Tim Tebow stories, second tier LeBron James stories, NASCAR, and college basketball (because the World Cup happens during their offseason).

Luckily, I didn't find too many female 215 pounders... That would have been awkward. If I did, I wouldn't have changed my approach at all, everyone is equal on the mat (until the ref raises a hand).

Sorry, but globes with dabs are the best...	Yea that's true, oil and keif are much more powerful. But as far as just smoking bud, I've always liked vaporizers the most. 
It's definitely an inconvenience, but I managed to play some Diablo without much trouble! Everything looks like you're underwater for quite a while... Vision should be good when I wake up tomorrow though! It is pretty scary, but way worth it.	Is there any way to be unconsious for the procedure?
The one thing I miss most about California.	Agreed. I don't mind seeing food on r/trees but whenever someone posts some of these I become quite sad. It's been years since I've had one of those wonderful burgers.

'oh fuck man'	That's the look of a man realizing he's going to have to commit murder. newlinechar  newlinechar At that point it's not even a choice and he's completely resigned to the eventual prison term - 'oh fuck man... why would you make me do this? That was a terrible idea.'
As soon as I read that line, I disregarded this. I've known plenty of autistic children to do this back in high school when we'd hear about them.	Yeah, they get frustrated because they can't communicate what's wrong, so they lash out. Biting is a pretty basic way of showing someone you're upset.
What's the worst part about eating bald pussy? newlinechar  newlinechar Putting the diaper back on.	I think this one's the most offensive one I've heard so far. I actually did [this](http://assets2.wordansassets.com/wvc-1333487214/wordansfiles/images/2012/4/3/135449/135449_340.jpg) face.

Thanks for that other subreddit, I had to unsubscribe from the GOT one after it got so bloated with memes from the show.	It's so much better.

Have you tried high% ethanol as well or like 99% alcohol? I think it would work a bit better than the vinegar plus you can evaporate it and smoke the resin after if that is how you roll	Vinegar isn't to clean. You use ISO for that. Vinegar acts as a protective seal you put on a piece after you have cleaned it. It keeps resin from building.  newlinechar  newlinechar I haven't really tried it, nor do I know if it works well. 
No, that's the reserved spot for delivery boys, since our parking lot is so small, and it's always full.	i retract my previous statement. My bad.

Indeed, mine did too. I had done integration, differentiation and differential equations before I left high school.	The higher level integration (integration by parts etc) wasn't even that hard either and yet I hear people complaining about it. It's just like any other maths.

TBH I hate the downvote/dislike system on the forums.

'Segregation Now, Segregation Tomorrow, Segregation Forever.' newlinechar George Wallace (D) 1963.... newlinechar  newlinechar Keep in mind this was two years before African Americans had the right to vote, and well past the 'early' 20th century. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 	At the time, the dependent factor was really where you were from.   The senator who introduced the civil rights acts of 1964 and 1968 was from New York.  All the asshats that filibustered it were southerners, who were accustomed to a racist milieu.

I want to see a cycle of 'big lords' across all the colors... I'm calling it, Siege-Gang Commander is coming back!	Siege-gang would be pretty sweet, but I would point out that he's not actually a lord, he just shits goblins.  Goblin Chieftain would make a bit more sense in that regard.

Good read!  I have so many shields split, but after reading this, I will be doing a facing of some kind whether it be a thin leather or a linen and hide glue cover.	Don't forget the recommendation to use plywood. 
I love how 'Brand new' is a bullet point in the technical details.  I guess lots of light bulbs you get online are brand old or something?	I'm quite certain they mean it's a new product as in this is a new model, not just that no one has used it before.
An upvote for you effort.	And upvote for saying you upvote 
thats so awesome ;_; all the ones I ever see run away too quickly. I'm also afraid they may have rabies.

So... could he?	I think that he was forced to give up his magic for his spider powers. He went on to trying to grab one of the dragon's grandmothers and the line went where he wanted the dragon to stop existing because he was never supposed to have been born. =/

That's the rub... I think that counseling can't really fix being an idiot or being an asshole, and it's one of those, if not both, that are getting Kaner in trouble.	Exactly.  If he's got a drinking problem, by all means, get him some help.  I think he just makes dumb choices though.

I would recommend Android over IOS since you don't have to do that much paper work or pay for anything, on top of that you'll get tons of support.  	Both platforms have active support communities. Contrary to sanimalp's comment, neither Objective C nor Xcode (for OS X development) costs money to use. I'd recommend the OP start with OS X to get the hang of the language and APIs and then moves to iOS.
Liquitex Basics with Fabric Medium mixed in. :)	Shoes are dope dude. You really should get a website and setup a side business project. Posting to reddit/gaming is always going to nail you customers.

At least there are some comments calling it out. I find it so amazingly condescending and patronising to post this in /r/aww, it's boggling me. Awww look at the cute puppies.

This has gotten so out of hand by the start of the season I'm going to be severely disappointed if he's not the second coming of Christ. Anything less than a 1000 yard game and 3 rushing touchdowns will be a failure.	Yeah I agree. No one seems to understand the season Cam Newton had last year as a rookie.

Who will oppose this? Not the restaurants, for they can sell more drinks at smaller sizes, raising profits. Not the soft drink companies, for the same reason.

The soft drink companies will oppose it (and if you read the article, you'll see they've already issued official statements against it) because if it works and people DO drink less of those 'evil beverages', they'll lose money.

WTF, why go to a pet store? They sell fish at a grocery store. You sick fuck.	It needs time to not rot. But I agree that a fish as small as the ones at the pet store won't smell enough. Get something at the grocery store, or even better, fish it yourself.

Send an email to Gaben, seriously. They've done so much for such smaller reasons. Who knows, you might get a tour of Valve and tons of free swag, or at the least something TF2 related signed.	I'll try that, thank you!

This is such a horribly done segment. The script, the way its read, the scene cuts, the interviews, dear god do these people know nothing anymore about proper technique	Its like they are trying to make a messy hype report to get popular on youtube. There is more opinion and drama talk from the 'reporter' than who, what, when, where.
that shirt reminds me of the shirt theo asked denise to make him in The Cosby Show because he was too cheap to buy the real thing.  	Yes, haha!  Good call.  I love that episode.

Will y'all go back to screening vectors for quality? Because, seriously, some bad stuff can be found in the vector club. I understand letting everyone contribute and all that jazz, but I'd say a case of quality over quantity would be nice for this kind of thing. Just a thought.	Wait... but we do. Like, that's all we do. A lot of the old stuff is pretty shitty, but all the new stuff goes through a screening process.

At the same time, dealers are risking their ass by servicing people's bud habits, so if they need to take their sweet ass time from time to time...well, at least they're getting it!

Autistic kids can be incredibly strong and ridiculously violent if they get scared, frustrated, or angry.

So that's at least 1300 teenagers, still with the possibility of 2600+ from the way it is worded.  I still believe it is a typo because when conducting surveys/studies, all participants must answer all questions lest their entire submission be thrown out.

It hasn't even been published. This is probably a case of media being overly enthusiastic about a meaningless study. 
The stuff being taught in schools right now is old, the textbooks aren't keeping up with current studies.  In 10 years we'll probably be hearing to not eat a month at a time in order to lose optimal fat :)	That's pretty much what I was thinking - this info sounds quite out of date.
Not to be mean, but if you got 100% on the final in 143, but only got a 3.6 then you must have dropped the ball in some other area.	I got an 84% on the midterm and ~90% on the homeworks (if I recall correctly). The curve that quarter was just fucked, on the final especially.

In my experience, these kind of things are virtually unavoidable. However, in most cases (including yours) the problem is so minuscule that most people wouldn't even notice it unless you pointed it out to them.	True, just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something terribly obvious.
Late game it might seem trivial but when you are using a 1/10 of your mana for each W and 1/4 for your E, combos get pretty expensive at low levels. 	Don't even need to combo, just wack em with a W every couple of seconds. You can kill people from 60% with one combo.

A 'normal person' wouldn't seek out advice from others before a confrontation? And I wouldn't say this is a rhetorical question.

Yes, I totally am not an alt account of Positronix and I agree with his sentiment.	I am an entirely different person and ThePhenix's statement is very true, just like Positronix's.
I don't particularly like Worf more than any other character, but sure.  Any Trek movie that feels like the old stuff would be cool with me.	Seriously, at this point any link to the main continuity would be great with me. New series about the dinosaur people in voyager teaming up with amelia earhart? At this point, yes please. 
Better. All the escalators have blocks with question marks suspended above them  that provide free gold coins to us if we jump correctly. 	I fucking knew it.
yessir	Damn, was hoping for Weston, CT

VVVVVV was already in Humble Bundle #4. newlinechar  newlinechar 	Yeah, that definitely will not happen. newlinechar  newlinechar What I do think could happen is: one of the frictional games games gets added (Penumbra), it was already in the first bundle ever, but I think it would work out. 
Isn't that what they intended? By reading the latest game update, they said they wanted people to focus on damage mitigation and survivability	They said they want to shift the focus away form survivabilty and more towards dealing damage. 
*Smacks head* Sorry... I just wanted to get the marches out and I worked all day. Next time I shall use that.	Great. It's awesome to know you have a vision for the future of RCW, I look forward to being involved in it!
Digital natural distortion?	no naturally digital distortion. 
Speaking as an AT&amp;T customer: don't get AT&amp;T. They've got terrible coverage out here. newlinechar  newlinechar I hear Verizon's decent, but I can't personally confirm/deny that.	But seriously, do not get AT&amp;T.
I noticed this before the DLC came out on my GI while using the GPS, perhaps it's a charge-weapon glitch?	This is correct.  Any weapon with a chargeable shot (GPS, Graal, Kishock, Krysae) can cause spontaneous de-cloaking.  There is no way that I have found to remedy the situation; so be careful when using the Krysae, you may not always be cloaked.

'This game would be amazing if it wasn't for every single bad thing about it.'	Without it's flaws, it might've been the next Mass Effect. Despite it's many flaws, it was still fun.
I haven't seen either, but I feel like I probably would enjoy that type of movie! However, the way The Last Airbender was butchered by M. Night Shyamalan makes me not want to watch any of his movies ever again:/ If it's really good though I'll try it!	It's one of the best surreal origin super hero movies ever.
Dude, that's not funny. My Grandfather died in the Holocaust. He fell out of the guard tower.	My Grandfather died in 1943 at Auschwitz when another officer fell on him.

Should be really easy. you could probably just pick a language and learn how to make a calculator. tons of tutorials do calculators so you could just tweak it to do that.	Good call. Thanks for finding out the exact height of a NES game for me.
If you are not actually going to provide an argument or answer any of the questions I just raised, please do not bother in making a reply. 	Spanking is a violation of the NAP, a very basic part of being an ancap. I'd be glad if a person who supports aggression against children decided to not call him or herself an ancap.
Google Scholar usually provides a few good sources.	Google Scholar is subject to spam, the Matthew Effect and has been known to index SCIgen articles. Not to say it can't provide good sources. Just throwing out some info. 
I know right? Maybe I should become an alcoholic like JCM and drown myself in it from all the shilling....	Many of the best writers have been alcoholics. Hemingway for example. So go with Josh's lead and drink like a fish, destroy all your brain cells, and then spout shit on the Internet. Can't lose!

I'm so not racist that I don't even know what race I am. But if I'm white, that would be highly offensive so I reported and upvoted you. Also, can someone buy me reddit gold? I'm a bit short this month.	If you give me your cash money I'll buy reddit gold for you
Yea. It is the old 'Haha I was just there! I was a part of that' effect that causes people to upvote this stuff not once, not twice, but three times. 	I don't know why, but [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKgPY1adc0A) is all I thought when I read your comment.

This is precisely what I was going to say. Watch how she treats waiters, bartenders, cab drivers, etc. the way you treat people that you feel are 'below' you reveals a great deal about you as a human being. 	Just feeling that they are below you/inferior to you is a sign to DTMFA.

I dunno, I mean, I'm no expert on women's weightlifting, and generally, the women bodybuilders I have seen kinda give me the heeby-geebys, but that picture did not appear to be the picture of a weight lifter.

Just like some of the competitors in the strongest men competitions, she's not cut but she is definitely very strong.

First person to die on Mars.... achievement unlocked?	Eventually someone will have to do it to help mankind progress. Someone were the first to die at sea, someone were the first to die in space.
This isn't an intrinsically religious quote, and it does make sense. It means that while your misfortunes may seem dire, there is someone else who is suffering more. 	Or it means *Score, free shoes - he won't be needing them anyway*

Very friendly, not a great speaker though. Every time I would give him an update, he would sincerely thank me. He just seemed like a genuine guy.

If you relinquish ownership you would forget all knowledge of the Death Note(s) unless you're touching a piece from it, IIRC, so that plan wouldn't work.

That was an interesting read. However, the sample size chosen from DC and Marvel was quite small. The author notes so.

Four cases that only apply to the adjectives and the articles, which really isn't too bad relative to other languages. Finnish has 14 or 15 cases, which affect the nouns themselves.

I think it goes further than that. To me it implies that Hitler did not kill himself at all, and was always killed by that guy, so he only just completed history in a twisted sort of way.

I would be careful what details about yourself you give away, if you'd like to keep your anonymity...	Yeah, OP should probably edit or delete this.
really good point. the most annoying thing I think you hit on the head; it just feels like they did not even try and maybe like you say that is their modus operandi.	But it's insidious because the casual critics &amp; fans will LOVE it and spread great word-of-mouth.

Is that really a close enough of a resemblance to be labelled as a reference to MTG? The name is the same, but the name is fairly generic... and it's just a ghost with big teeth and stuff.

Yep, early access and HoNs shitty F2P model is what killed that game for me. 	The F2P model I thought wasn't too bad - some skins were a bit off (you didn't know what hero that was until you checked), but otherwise it was decent with the taunts and announcer packs.

In all seriousness-- how does one even get into that hobby?  I can't imagine anvils are available at the hobby lobby. 	As hobbies go, it's surprisingly cheap.

I like it. People say I'm much more peaceful; and it is a religion that has taught me to be a very critical thinker; and many more reasons.	I mean no disrespect to you, but to say that religion, of all things, has taught you to be a 'critical thinker' seems rather...illogical. Could you expound on this?

The whole thought of blood bending gave me chills, and even Katara breaking down at the end of the episode iced the cake on that. [Euuughhh](http://i.imgur.com/Ap0dh.jpg).	Besides the horror genre, one thing that I liked was how it explained why there weren't any waterbenders in the Southern Water Tribe.
Nah. Last year she quit... Gave her 2 weeks, big public hoohaa and then decided 5 days later she's rather keep her job. She's awful. 	What the hell? How was she even allowed in the building/access to sending shit like this out?

I like the vanilla revolver	Nothing wrong with that.
I think in that context, 'girlfriend' by itself would have been more appropriate. But it's tricky finding unambiguous terms for everything.	Well, the guy's name is 'dranker,' so maybe we don't need to worry about the perfect term so much.

This is how it's always been in D2 as well so old players are used to it.  It wasn't really that big a deal in D2 but now it drives me crazy.	That is because the attack animations in D2 didn't take half a second to complete. I think the fact that you can avoid certain attacks by running away is a factor as well.
I'm not sure what peeves me more -- The fact that the general public believes we're actually working on 'a cure for cancer', or the fact that we need to convince them of that for funding of cancer research.	Well it's hardly their fault. You can't expect every member of the public to have an intricate understanding of medical science, and when the media sells the idea of a singular cancer, I think it's perfectly understandable that people view Cancer as one disease.

By the way, speaking of vectors, I still cant forgive you for rotating through my super awesome HD logo in less than 2 days. That thing was destined for glory!	I didn't change it. Go yell at Orsch. I don't know if he changed it, you should just yell at him.

Como si lesionar o lastimar a un jugador no tuviera ninguna consecuencia mas alla del partido.
I agree with both of you, for I TOO am Australian.	Australia unite!
The judiciary isn't a branch of our government?	It is a branch of the US government, but it is not what people mean when they say 'the government'.  When they say that they mean the legislative or the executive branches.  When they mean the judiciary, they say 'the courts'. newlinechar 
Dragon is a privately owned unit.  No nation was involved with building and launching it.  However the company Space X will get a contract with the US and NASA now.	Better than hitching a ride with Russia and cramming their astronauts into a tiny Soyuz capsule.

I'm ok with being second choice to teams which are actually (and definitely) better than us, i.e. Madrid and Barca. It would be unreasonable to expect anything more until we have more success.	How do you intend to achieve success if we are everyone's second-choice and less preferred option?

I don't see how Schürrle doesn't start ahead of Podolski with his recent national team form. It seems almost immediately after he comes on, he scores with an excellent, powerful shot.	I'm not a big fan of Podolski but he is a workhorse. So when Schürrle comes onto the pitch, his opponents are tired.

we've only done the survival island one, that was very fun. your nomad idea sounds cool, i may have to chat with our server to give it a go. (not the getting thrown out bit maybe you just get thrown back to your home)	Well the reason we do no respawning is since you're constantly moving away from your spawn, trying to get people who spawn back without teleporting is a bit of a pain, and honestly ruins the threatening vibe of the game.
This is the scariest part of almost every apocalypse senario. The last time I checked around 10% of Americans are on antidepressants or antipsychotics.

Two's compliment has the nasty side effect of halving the largest representable positive signed integer. With balanced ternary you'd no longer have to worry about 'signed' and 'unsigned'.

'Abrechnung' also has connotations of revenge, or at least a sense of negativity, while 'reckoning' isn't necessarily used that way.  I know it's a correct literal translation, but I've never seen 'abrechnen' in this context used in anything but a negative, payback sense.	Right, the metaphorical 'abrechnen' is negative, I thought the metaphorical 'reckoning' in english was too. Maybe 'settling of scores' is better?

Have you read anything by Moore after Watchmen? His writing is of a constant and reliable quality. His ABC work is astounding. Lost Girls, the most recent of his work I've read (2006 I think), was great. newlinechar  newlinechar Frank Miller made All-Star Batman in 2005.	Don't misunderstand, I love work done by both writers mentioned, I just think it unnecessary to put them up too highly. newlinechar  newlinechar On Lost Girls, it didn't do much for me.

Good luck not having nightmares involving shaved, pimple-covered orangutans wiggling their asses at you.	You should say that to me every night from now on.
There is a difference between 'good looking kid' and 'I'm so upset that she is 15 because I want to tear that ass apart bro'. 	Well to be fair, every time someone calls the young girls in the cast beautiful or any synonym of this word, everyone flips the fuck out.

The dying man told him not to call.	What's the law regarding suicide attempts (genuinely curious, not an attempt at sarcasm)?

I get the feeling Trapped_In_Reddit is multiple people, and not evil. Could be wrong though, 'Karmanaut' and 'Trapped in Reddit' certainly share a theme of exploring the reddit-verse	That idea of multiple people was always thrown around about Karmanaut a few years back, too.

Ah, the 'shaggy' qualifier for the unicorns makes that assumption make more sense. 	Also, the idea that a unicorn is a horned horse is relatively new. The unicorns of greek myth were one-horned goats.
That's why chewing gum is against health codes. 	Also, wounds need to be covered by more than a band-aid, preferably latex-free gloves. This should never have happened.
Simply *defining* people as evil does not actually *make* them evil by any reasonable or independent standard.	But if they are actually evil then it would be right (morally and epistemically) to define them as such.

Oh my god...Link is the master potter of hyrule! That's why no one gets angry when he walked into their house and smashes all te pots! 	It is all so clear now. Does this also mean that he is a grass making deity or is he just the master gardener of the kingdom?

Why is that?  It's the opposite in a lot of other countries.	It's because of tribalism. In Kenya each tribe is a little bit suspicious of each other. Plus it does not help that one tribe tends to hold most of the power in politics and business even though Kenya has 42 tribes.

A lot of people tear bites of roti with hand, like bread, directly from the basket and use fork and knife on everything else.
ash being in a coma for the pokemon anime was a great read. 	yea but that was more about the analysis and symbolism than the twist. Actually this statement is generally true.

The other 45% percent thinks that they share a lot of staff between teams, which is kinda true (Chris Metzen, for example) 	I see. I really hope they utilize more of the resources from the WOW team to help out especially in terms of server stabilization/optimization etc... crossing my fingers :) 
No necessarily - cats know how to bite lightly. Have you never play-fought with a kitten? They take your fingers between their teeth but it doesn't hurt.	True, their teeth doesn't hurt....Their claws though, god dammit how they can scratch wounds easily!

I really don't agree with the vote-spoiling, but that's some nice handwriting	I think I prefer people spoil the vote then don't understand.

This is really well made. Also, I can't believe people are actually complaining about the start menu being gone. If you need to search for something, press Windows Key + Q.

What is this wizardry called google? I've been just typing random addresses to the browser bar to find funny pictures.	This reminds me of the time when search engines sucked and people actually used this method to find useful websites. It worked surprisingly well... at least compared to the search engines at the time.
Fuck yeah! I have 'every start may be a sun to someone' tattooed on my back [from I believe chapter 3 of Cosmos]. People think it's some sort of fancy love quote, and then I like to tell them it's just about the possibility of life on other planets. 	That's really lovely! It might not be a love quote, but I still think it's romantic.

If you ask me, $99 for MS to sign your virus boot-loader sounds like a total bargain. newlinechar  newlinechar And if a boot-loader shim is happy to run anything (signed or not) then it kinda makes a mockery of the whole secure boot idea, doesn't it?	The idea (although I'm not sure about the implementation) is that Microsoft wouldn't blindly hand out keys to anyone with $99, and that they'd look into the legitimacy of the request.  That being said, that's a shitty way to try to practice security.

I'll ask what is on everyone's mind.  Is there anyway that you can tell us how much you paid?  I understand if you don't want to!	I paid $3500.

If you wanna wax metaphysics then I'm pretty sure deadric princes can't create at all, only change.   Most cults tend to stick to the revrence of one diety as Princes seem to be jelousm angry sorts of things that don't often work together.	I may be wrong, but I do think Daedra can create.

Commodity auctions have been down almost twice as long as they've been up. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not saying it will **always** be a failure, but as of today, the gold auction house is pretty much a failure.

I'm guessing transfer speeds won't be awesome, perhaps even worse than using the built in LAN port, if you hook up both network and a harddrive to the USB2 host.

Drowning several *living* creatures because you can't be bothered to find homes for them is considered what then?  Killing is killing.  There is a reason so many serial killers started their careers off by torturing and killing animals.	Yes killing is killing, but murder has a specific definition: killing another *human being*.

Assuming PRC takes over Japan, I don't think they'll allow the Rising Sun being incorporated as a symbol, ever. The Rising Sun flag symbolizes the imperial Japan on that neighborhood.

Same. I watched about half last night, paused because it was too late not because I got bored, and my interest was held the entire time. The movie makes me want to read the books, which makes it a success in my opinion.	I never even knew there were books.

This is a very passive aggressive approach. If you are looking for a smooth, calm way out of this I would absolutely NOT recommend this course of action.

But they in essence heal you for the exact same amount. There is no difference between either of those heals in any way that would relate to survivability.

I just bought a used T2i body 2 weeks ago on ebay for $446 with shipping. Its practically mint with less than 2,000 actuations. I think your buddy wants too much for his.

If you listen to the radio, they already do...but you don't pay, the broadcaster does (a large blanket license)...because they are profiting from the music via advertising revenue.  You aren't profiting so don't worry about it.	They pointed out taverns as one of the venues that will have to pay - but in my experience, most taverns rely either on satellite radio subscriptions or local radio for their music. Guess the price of beer is going up.
Well, here in the U.S., the citizens have guns. Doesn't it make sense for the people guarding all the money to have them too?	I don't get the idea of carrying weapons all the time; things can get out of hand so much faster.

Same here, except i'm playing the PC version. I played the MGS3 on the 3ds and was hooked.

HD collection is pretty amazing, though be warned mgs3 doesn't play like the 3DS version, the 3DS version was enhanced and updated with more shit. The HD collection is just that, HD versions of the game, no updated textures etc.

They're probably kicking themselves that they didn't. Honestly, Oracle probably had deeper pockets.

Lets not forget either that the British weren't really fighting us, they were fighting the French.

What I love about the Descent is that you can see the monsters in almost all the scenes prior to the big reveal. They're in the shadows moving around out of focus.

I stared at JFK's head for quite a while before figuring out this is a recreation... I guess it was obvious in hindsight	yea the top right (looking at him) side of his head should have been blown off. And im pretty sure he slumped to the back corner of his seat. IDK i have to watch the vid again

And thus, by extension, Davos really *earned* that lordship. He didn't just save Stannis, he potentially saved the whole rebellion.	To be fair, even if Davos didn't get them the onions, the plans to start eating the dead were already in place. In fact, when Stannis wanted to execute a few turncloaks by throwing them out via catapult, his Maester actually told him not to waste the fresh meat.

when you said the father died, do you mean the food killed him or was the father the only person who could cook the food well and with him gone the food was bad?	The father kept the restaurant running well. The father died, the son took over. The son drove it into the ground, never cleaned, used the outdoor patio and part of the dining room as storage etc
I don't understand this. People hate that is doesn't crit? I feel like it needs more words.	I have to agree.  As someone who has played TF2 for a long time, but doesn't stay very current with it -- this graphic makes no sense.

You guys are lucky,you have cheap and fast internet and cheap smartphones! newlinechar I would go for the nexus just because of the updates.	You guys have more disposable income though :) The updates, on-screen buttons and the near instant camera shutter is what is pulling me towards the nexus, but the S2 does have better 3d-graphics capability, slightly better screen, and slightly better camera quality.
Not in the slightest. A fiance would have fought tooth and nail over that, and vowed never to let it leave her sight again.  newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that she is willing to just give it up speaks poorly of her.

I'll take the fact that you've been studying them and didn't call me an idiot that my description was at least okay haha	Yeah, it seemed pretty on the nose to me.  You're right though, the fugue stuff is absolutely wild.
You're probably right. I just wanted the opinion of people who would be unbiased, and this subreddit seemed a good place. Historians are trained to be neutral (I would think).	Historians are assumed to be neutral, but given cultural context, biased-perspective accounts or resources, and multiple modes of pedagogy, this is *realistically* not the case.
This implies your classmates understood the concepts of fair play and sanity.  newlinechar  newlinechar Mine did not.	This is exactly why I hate dodgeball. If everybody were honest, it'd be fine. But no, at least half of the kids cheat, EVERY GODDAMN TIME.

Other bands could only wish to be so lucky. 
`Ctrl+S` to save? Seriously?	Why do you disagree?
You watched that shit while you're at work??	The w wasn't capitalized. So it was more of a sugestion not a requirement.
Probably the reddit effect.	That's a nice way of saying accidentally ddos'd a server. 
are record labels / stores generally so bad that we have to praise the ones that actually do what they are supposed to do? 	Oh, those looks one gets at record shops after anouncing that the full price for a new warped, scratched or in any other way damaged record is unreasonable...
I honestly think anything he's said about gay marriage and other related social issues has just been to appease the evangelical votes. I don't see him really caring about it enough to do much once he's in office. 	Mitt Romney will say anything to appease voters, to the point he often contradicts himself.  How do you know what he will do or not do in office?  I don't even think Mitt Romney himself knows.  The man is just another puppet.

I don't think this really covers it. It's not a reason not to be an atheist; it's a reason to be other things as well.	Or instead.  It's a reason not to define yourself by what you are not. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, if you are asking me for a reason to be a theist, that's an entirely different question.

Keep it clean? Might want to use some bleach to get rid of those pesty stains. 	[A-thank-you](http://instantrimshot.com/)
Wasn't crafting picture with many tiny moves of the brush, often in contrasting colors a staple of impressionism?	[](/rtsilikethis) I won't debate art movements on a Twilight Sparkle sub, but the outlines are rather strong, continuous and expressive, in my opinion. So are the colors. It's probably neither Expressionism nor Impressionism, let's just enjoy it.

God forbid they should have a new IP.	No one buys systems for new IP.
Because of the strength and durability of floss in water (salted or chlorinated) opposed to simple thread?	Hmmm, maybe you're right. I was thinking Nylon thread would probably be more appropriate for this application, but I guess that's just because I've never seen anyone use dental floss for sewing :P
Obama has released his *twice*, and it was recently re-confirmed to be legit by a *Republican* in Hawaii, for Arizona's elections board.  newlinechar  newlinechar What else do you want Donald?	To be a God of course. His ego will fill all the universes and, especially, the wormholes.

My understanding is that there's an electrolytic reaction, just like when you make an electric cell by pushing metal rods into a lemon.   newlinechar  newlinechar It doesn't need an external power source because the slug (in combination with the copper) *is* the power source.

Ancaps believe in the NAP. newlinechar Spanking violates the NAP newlinechar Therefore ancaps reject spanking. newlinechar This isn't hard stuff. You don't need studies to see violence, especially against children, is wrong and shouldn't be accepted. You wouldn't hit someone else's kid so why should you hit your own?	You're working off the assumption that parents spank children for no reason. In fact most spankings are a reaction to something a child has done first. Self-defense or defense of others is not a violation of the NAP. 
What do you mean by a speedart? like a time-lapse painting?	I think it is where you record the whole painting process on a shoe and then speed it up so that people can see the whole thing in just a few minutes. newlinechar  newlinechar Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

29-30 sounds alright to me. What makes you think you've done it wrong.	When trying to mount the cooler, I lifted it a little from the CPU and saw that the paste had been spread only on about 60% of the surface.

Services that rely on imported cost inputs such as fuel would benefit from devaluation? Are you mad? newlinechar  newlinechar The only thing devaluation devalues is the price of labor.	The whole point is to devalue the price of labor. Either by devaluation (depreciation) or internal devaluation (wage cutting).

Why the fuck are so many proud when it comes to the act of rapeing?

That's just always how things have been here.	The phone line provides enough electricity to run the phone handset.  newlinechar  newlinechar Do your landline phones really plug into the wall?
Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle had cutie marks in the previous generations, though I doubt they will be kept (if at all shown), since there have been changes with the mane six's marks already.	&gt; if at all shown newlinechar  newlinechar True that, forever ablank newlinechar  newlinechar Also, loved the pic, the cutie marks were friggin' right, i wonder who smacked some sense into their superhard skulls?
'A smallish group of ladies not particularly good at math or birth control' doesn't have quite the same ring though, does it?	I personally like this better. When a name of a company tells you what the company does, it sticks in your mind. If it doesn't, you think 'Ummmmm..... Dafuq?'.  newlinechar  newlinechar I would rather a name be truthful.
pffft he's only a hobbyist urinist.	A [pissant](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pissant), you might say.
I'm getting tired of reading about cunting tyres.	TIL 'cunt' is a verb.
&gt;unrational decisions newlinechar  newlinechar Why would 'support your own' be unrational? Does rational really equal cheapest?	Define 'your own'. Your town? Your state? Your country? Your continent? Your planet? You're happy to disadvantage another human being because of some arbitrary line in the sand and a few minor regional differences?
no, sorry.	It's working now.  [Unaltered screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/XP8TQ.jpg), of course you will just have to take my word for it.
If you remove the cooler I would recommend applying fresh paste. Your temperatures are reasonable though so don't bother unless they get akk funky.	I agree, every time you break contact with the past and cooler, you need to remove all paste and apply fresh paste.  Also some paste takes time to settle in.
with battery recharge and bb resupply stations. holy funking orgasmic that's great.	Comeon man, man up! We carried enough BB's water batteries and food at OPP to last us the whole game - No reason why a few guys in each squad can't run backpacks for the whole group.
How many times do we have to say it. RANDOM. Not charity acts of pizza. RANDOM. This is a perfectly acceptable request and much better than all the sob stories around here. Good luck to the OP.	TOTALLY AGREE..... and OP, check your PM :)
Basically, *Animal Farm* was denouncing Soviet socialism because it was totalitarian, is that correct?	Correct, it wasn't about the redistribution of wealth but of the oppressive and hypocritical government (all animals are equal...but some are more equal than others)
How do you know that it kicked you out?	Posts like this are why I tend to wonder if Ketostix do more harm than good sometimes. 
well, i don't know what to say to this other than pvp is not the only thing in Eve Online.	no it isn't. but its a part of almost everything. miners will have to learn to defend themselves or they will continue dying. Its simple as that.
...all just waiting for the inevitable decay that time brings to be broken and to be replaced with grief, betrayal and death.	I think they're both as inevitable as each other.
I wouldn't do that as it might piss Brad off. newlinechar  newlinechar The last thing OP needs is Brad all pissed off and looking for vengeance.	Or, more realistically, to have some friends side with Brad...
The year it was made should be stamped on the rifle near the serial number, although its possible it could be too lightly struck to see. The B could also be the Savage S, sometimes they look like B's or 8's.	I don't think it had a year stamped, but I'll take a much closer look around. And I'm pretty sure it's a B, I can tell it apart from from the square looking S's :)
But it's high-fucking-school. Jeebus. 'Mericans sure crack me up sometimes.   newlinechar Are scissors allowed?	Stupidity and idiocy are not limited to American borders. newlinechar  newlinechar And scissors are allowed. newlinechar  newlinechar My concerns with public schools are the lack of sanity controls.  newlinechar  newlinechar That is, mentally ill students/teachers can gain authority/just go completely fucko bazoo. newlinechar  newlinechar 
The other one is named Juliet.	Thanks! 
this is the same kind of asshole who thinks since young male drivers have to pay more car insurance because of 'misandry'	It's funny how when biotruths are anti-woman it's just the facts of the world, but when they work against men it's suddenly 'misandry.' 
Use a credit card for lots of things! Build your credit score! But make sure you have the money to pay them back AND at least 6 months rainy day funds. 	Note: This only applies in the US. Everywhere else it's great advice to not live on credit.

Thanks for the recommendation.  It's actually kind of surprising that you can't use the cards from the original; considering how many different sets there are, you'd think it would've been easy/useful to integrate them into the boardgame version.	I'm sure you could if you really wanted to, just try to ignore the different backs of the cards. Then again, you'd have to take out additional monsters that didn't have standees, but items and equipment would work
They need to do way instain motherboard. 	These mapping cant frigth back.

Eh, I don't know. I can't help thinking Patchface is a Bombadil-like character that works on paper but would look *really* stupid on screen, and not in a good way.	Yes. The 2 seconds of screen time that Dontos had as a fool was really bad, I'm not suprised they cut most of his scenes. Fools don't really work in the show.
I love it when OP delivers.	I feel like thats been happening a lot more often recently.

You did not *really* stay meaningfully productive for 20 hours straight.  Your exhausted, sleep deprived, delusional brain might have thought you did.  It was wrong.  You were producing crap and would have produced higher quality work faster if you hadn't have done that.	If I produced crap, I would hope my professors would have noticed and given me low marks for it.
igetitnow.jpg	although it would be a better joke if they didn't use 'eggshell' as a color. i used to work in a paint department, and this drove me nuts. eggshell is a sheen, not a color. eggshell could be light blue, after all.
Don't be dumb, that is a line straight from Family Matters. It's basically Urkel's most famous line.	Yeah, but Urkel doesn't say it when he's Urkel. Its only after he goes through the cool machine and becomes Stephon does he really use that line.
Athletics and Acrobatics, Oblivion style. I miss maxing them both out and sprint jumping off cliffs and flying halfway across the country :( haha.	Damn, I need to play Oblivion.
Even though it's a waste, it's a pretty good kind of waste.  	Yea.  It's absolutely worth it.  
I actually see this as nothing to be smug about, if that really is a picture of a cop car getting a fine, then it is one governemt department taking money from another and paying someone to do it, all on taxpayer time and money.	Well, I don't know where you've worked, but every place I've worked at requires the driver to pay speeding fines/parking fines, not the company, I imagine it's the same for most other people.
I'll prepare my armed bear.	Bear cavalry reporting in, sir!
What is wrong with unpredictability?	F1 teams don't like it because it makes a lot of their background work seem useless.

Sorry on my phone hit reply too soon newlinechar  newlinechar My advice don't be sorry don't be ashamed know you are wonderful and they are a tool. Most importantly trust yourself.	Thank you. I do trust myself, and I *think* I have no major regrets about this event.
So self-interest counts as a reason when corporations do it, but not when governments, politicians, or segments of the electorate do it?	well a lot of the harm isn't intended. It's done for noble reasons with bad consequences. 
Definitely give Mason and Dixon a shot. It is a bit more approachable than some of Pynchon's other works. Plus it's very apropos with a Transit of Venus coming at the end of this month! 	I'm debating between M&amp;D and Against the Day on which one I want to read first.

/r/Longboarding is confused why it isn't moving and under your feet.	because im forever alone and had nobody to take a picture for me. xD

I do say sir. The first comment was 'Hi!' - They said NOTHING about them wanting it.

So make yourself a list of known, trusted experts on a variety of topics, and if something seems fishy (or someone tells you it seems to be), contact them and ask for assistance.

You forgot the Toon aswell.	i was gonna put them in the list as well, but wasn't sure if they will keep up the same form next season. I hope they do, they were awesome.
The ACC will be in trouble when it has less than 12 schools. It's currently on track for 14...hardly the time to panic.	You can't honestly tell me that you'd be happy with the ACC as a football conference if it didn't include FSU and Clemson. The Big East has 13 football members. Do they have no reason to panic?

Am I missing something? I didn't think 8 CMC cards were ever considered playable outside of fairly extreme circumstances, such as cheating them into play.	There was a Jund deck that splashed blue for Deny Reality and Nicol Bolas back in the day that ramped with Lotus Cobra and some other sweet interactions.  Nicol Bolas isn't unplayable in standard by any means, he's a crazy good threat.

I don't think companies would randomly serve smaller or healthier portions just out of the goodness of their hearts unless the culture was trending that way *naturally*.
You don't use AC adapters for those? You're gonna have a bad time.	Personally, I do.  But some musicians prefer to use *slightly* weak 9Vs to get more interesting sounds outta their pedals.
Yeah, but physical filters, software filters, doesn't matter. You do it your way, I'll do it mine. Don't bitch to me that I'm 'not doing it right'. Unless I ask you for advice ... which I won't.	Yeah, if someone is condescending for any type of action, fuck'em.
not everyone lives in your fucked up country.	Yeah, because the U.S. is the *only* country with truancy laws.

I'm amazed you somehow got off the floor to type that. 	He uses hyperbole a lot.  He also said that Peyton Manning doesn't belong in the HoF because that means he's next to Montana and Young.

Yo ... Have patience. This is just the first DLC. Can't always get what you want.	Haha, of course. Honestly I am very appreciative of the hardwork Bethesda and its programmers put into the game. They're just...just awesome people.  
David Tennant, of course. I picture him when I picture the Doctor.	That's an instant friendship maker right there buddy. High five! 
Maybe, but usually young girls are not exactly proud of their developing or new breasts. They have many conflicting feelings about them.	What I was pointing at was how the boy was painted is all. We all say hurtful things when hurt ourselves even though we try not to, and children going through puberty are definitely irrational at best.
Ah, all the greats!	:D

Well, I'm too dumb to cure cancer, global warming, starvation or stop wars and rape from happening, and I was born in the wrong country to be able to influence world politics. newlinechar  newlinechar What can I do?	Live a happy life and don't do too much harm to others. Smile to strangers and every now and then give to charity.

You should just wait until the summer sale starts, where it's almost guaranteed to go to 75% off. Depending on the kind of sale, you may be able to find plenty of people willing to trade (check /r/steamgameswap and other related threads), or just straight up buy it for you	ah awesome yep think it's pretty lucky timing for that, just so i know when does the summer sale start?
that just lets you not type the password in plain text as part of the command.  very useful for batch files and scripting, so you don't store passwords in the source.	wait, what.. how does that work?

The fact that you're being downvoted is a true testament to what an America-hating circlejerk reddit is.  newlinechar  newlinechar Way to go, guys. You really showed wilsonh915 what an idiot he is! /s	In Australia, we say it as 'Ninth of January'. Or at least myself and people in my area do.

Nice tearjerker when Bruce is saying he's breaking his promise to his daughter and won't be coming home at the end. newlinechar  newlinechar Today its just another Michael Bay movie to turn my brain off and enjoy the fun characters.

I'm no expert, but I think that's for misdemeanors, such as underage drinking. A jail time sentence will likely stay on her record forever.	For misdemeanors, you can either pay the fine and get out, or you can stay in jail until the fine is paid (1 night = $100).  Truancy is a class C misdemeanor in TX.
Basically, Mexico can play any team, on any stadium in the US, and sell it out, as you can imagine, there are huge profits to be had	don't forget about money to made in mexico in a sold out 105,000 seat stadium either.
Need to read this again soon but one of the things I took from it is to ask people questions about themselves, people love talking about themselves.  	That's what I took from it, then spent 15 years trying to not talk about myself at all...
Give this man his damage!	Not my damageesss!
Actually, from the admittedly few times I've opened the downvoted comments, they're usually extraordinarily intolerant or stupid. Sure, the 'my opinion is different than yours' comments exist in the 'ultra-downvoted' category, but I've found that that's a minority.	You are right.  Usually the super downvoted comments are mother fuckers, it just makes me laugh when it's just a minority opinion being downvoted.  
Why? it's his house.	Agreed. My house has become weekend hangout place for my friends and my roommate's friends are over during the week. I don't get to play games anymore!

If they are written in such a way, you can have polymorphic malware. These can modify themselves. newlinechar  newlinechar Programs will do whatever they are programmed to do and won't deviate from that.	It's been a long time since I read about polymorphic viruses, but the biggest problem (as I recall) was that they tend to kill themselves with their mutations more far often than they improve themselves.

I completely understand what you mean and what the potential can be, even when projected to the level of extreme censorship.  I believe, even though it's probably *reductio ad absurdum*, that potential censorship is preferable to certain death. newlinechar 	Fair enough. I think this is just a fundamental difference where we, understandably and reasonably, disagree.
Just a note, I have utmost respect for you Aussies and hope to visit some day. I may just wait a few years to see if your GIANT KILLER SPIDER population drops at all.	Actually most of our killers spiders are tiny. The big ones are our Spiderbro's and we ride them to work.

&gt; we have to either **work** or pay to get the champions we actually WANT to play. newlinechar  newlinechar If you consider playing LoL and getting IP to unlock new content *work*, perhaps you should find a new game to play that you actually enjoy?	The definition of work isn't necessarily doing something without enjoyment, it means literally 'putting forth effort'.

Fuck yeah, now I have a reason to go to Hawaii.	beaches, sun, and women not enough?

What does beating on your wife have to do with men's rights?	You mean in contrast to [Mary Winkler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Winkler). Where she shot her husband in the back while he slept, and the same government set her free with no jail time.

The only explanation that seemed even remotely feasible is that they honestly thought they were following a success formula set by Transformers.  80s toy.. explosions.. uhm.. yeah.

I thought he was really boring and kind of annoying in the first season, but imo he got A LOT better in the second and third seasons. Not my favorite character in the series, but still way on top of most animated characters
Oh my god, nearly bought Amnesia the other day and I've been dying to buy Limbo for weeks... This is the best Humble Bundle (for me) ever. Thank you OP.

But why does /r/anarchism have moderators!?	Because the definition of anarchy is the absence of political rulers, not the absence of rules and hierarchy.

I don't know how much drop is on the Star, but with dropthrough mounting, it's pretty much Peaches without the slide through.

Man, I am glad you agree. Avatar is too much like a live action Ferngully and the message of hugging trees too prominent. I enjoyed it the first watch but I feel like the film has no rewatch value.
